      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that though there were some crazy thunderstorms yesterday afternoon, they had stopped by the time i had to bike home. i&#39;m thankful that i stopped at the grocery store intending to buy green beans and strawberries, but that they had neither. i&#39;m thankful that instead i got blueberries and materials for a salad, including cherry tomatoes, which d loves (i&#39;m thankful one of d&#39;s coworkers gave her a cherry tomato plant, which she planted in the front yard using a slotted spoon from our kitchen as a spade). i&#39;m thankful that though i forgot to buy balsamic vinegar, which we ran out of at the end of our post-vacation salad cleanse, but that there was half an old lemon in the fridge, which i combined with some honey to make something nice and bright (i&#39;m thankful, in writing this, to remind myself to buy another lemon on my way home tonight).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the oven was working better last night (i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s theory that perhaps we are overloading the circuit the igniter is on by also using it for our air conditioner, which seems persuasive) and so our potatoes were properly baked. i&#39;m thankful they were maybe even slightly too baked for d&#39;s taste, though i appreciated the crunchiness of the skin and the austere look it gave them, which reminded me of clambakes or the volcanic looking foraged preparations i&#39;ve seen in food tv shows about certain scandinavian restaurants. i&#39;m thankful for the &quot;bourbon and bleu&quot; flavored sausages i cooked, even though they aren&#39;t as good as the &quot;green chile&quot; flavored ones i cooked the past few days. i&#39;m thankful to have stained my hands with the juices of too-ripe blackberries.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheReportOfTheWeek">the report of the week</a>, a youtube channel i was introduced to by d, who was introduced to it by <a href="https://twitter.com/natazilla?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">natasha allegr</a>i, the creator of her favorite cartoon, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoKGhce5-08&list=PLoN30OVg6HsEM-zafhwXREScXnu8MkosO">bee and puppycat</a></em>. i&#39;m thankful for the setup, which is the teenage (?) reporter either in a nondescript room or in the front seat of a car, usually clad in a suit with slicked back hair, vampire pale, eating a fast or processed food product and reviewing it. i&#39;m thankful that of the many food reviews that i have watched on youtube, his possess this amazing strangeness which is unique to them (but perhaps owes something to a triangulation of nathan fielder and tom green and ed wood). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that he doesn&#39;t edit out his chewing (or anything) or take tiny bites like other food reviewers do; i&#39;m thankful that after fifteen seconds of chewing, he&#39;ll swallow and say something like &quot;<em>i&#39;m going to take three more bites</em>&quot; and then do exactly that. i&#39;m thankful for his atypically short sentences and hypnotic repetitions of key phrases like &quot;<em>the fact of the matter is&quot;</em> and lack of fear of silence. i&#39;m thankful that he&#39;s also not afraid to show discomfort or even disgust in the context of the food he&#39;s eating (i&#39;m thankful for the extreme distaste he shows for some domino&#39;s buffalo wings)(i&#39;m also thankful to have learned that he has <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/04/talking-with-report-of-the-week-youtubes-best-food-critic.html">literary aspirations</a>: &quot;<em>Lately I’ve been writing short stories anywhere between ten and 90 pages long</em>&quot;). (i&#39;m thankful, while writing this, to have been reminded of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2BJSV8Q1Yw">the tao lin episode of emily gould&#39;s &quot;cooking the books</a>,&quot; which will never not be hilarious to me)</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the other food reviewer we have been into lately, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/emmymadeinjapan">emmy cho</a>, who we first found on the tastemade snapchat discover channel but who has a vast youtube archive. i&#39;m thankful that her videos fit well as web examples of the &quot;sweet tv&quot; sub-genre <a href="https://theawl.com/let-them-bake-cake-d717986b279e#.smnhpt4i9">discussed by silvia killingsworth</a> in the context of bakeoff. i&#39;m thankful for the care and phenomenological flavor of her explorations of snacks. i&#39;m thankful for her  warm smile and for the way she cheerfully says &quot;<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=itadakimasu">itadakimasu</a>&quot; before she takes a bite.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that emmy&#39;s videos are polished and professional without being empty and soulless (which is maybe one of the hardest sweet spots for content to hit). i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.maskmagazine.com/the-truancy-issue/work/darcie-wilder">this interview with darcie wilder in <em>mask magazine</em></a>. i&#39;m thankful that when i think about the problems i sometimes have with social media, i would also, in giving it up, give up getting to read great new writing like hers. i&#39;m thankful for the part in the interview where she says, &quot;<em>My mom used to call me an acquired taste. Everyone either really liked me or hated me. It makes sense that I would do something where you want my annoying-as-hell voice, or you don’t at all.</em>&quot; which i really identified with.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that last night for dessert, after a workday that for some reason left me feeling particularly drained, i ate a pair of the new &quot;chocolatey caramel&quot; flavor of pop-tarts. i&#39;m thankful that d is still trying to cut back on dessert while i gave up on giving that up and so earlier in the week, when i ate my dessert pop-tarts, i did so while standing over the kitchen counter so as not to tempt her, the way i might not drink around someone who&#39;s just quit drinking. i&#39;m thankful she said that while that was nice of me, she doesn&#39;t mind if i eat them around her. i&#39;m thankful for the pop-tarts, which were good, even though i don&#39;t think they touch my all time faves, which are, in no particular order: brown sugar cinnamon, smores, and frosted strawberry. i&#39;m thankful, after finishing the tarts, for the raisins i shoveled in my mouth out of the box to try to fill my craving for sweetness, even though i really didn&#39;t need to eat them. i&#39;m thankful for the privilege to sometimes eat things when i really don&#39;t need to eat them.</p>
