        <p>i&#39;m thankful it is springtime. i&#39;m thankful for the feeling of it in the air and the way that the feeling in the air can affect the feeling in your body and the thoughts in your mind. i&#39;m thankful to have had a joyous band practice on friday night. i&#39;m thankful for the pleasure of being with other people and all paying attention to the same thing (in our case, the music). i&#39;m thankful, as someone who never really played sports or did any other kind of organized group activities, for how powerful it can feel to be working with other people to create something. i&#39;m thankful for all the in-jokes we have after only playing together for a few months. i&#39;m thankful that we&#39;ve added &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6O0mQ5Smxs">modern woman</a>&quot; (a song i suggested) to our repertoire and i&#39;m thankful for my favorite part of the song, the ending, where the guitarist and i sing one melody and the keyboardist and the singer sing another one. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that at the end of the night, we played our cover of &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr9ZIB-HhgE">broken necks</a>&quot;, which, as i&#39;ve mentioned before, has a trick ending we added where it seems like the song is over but the drummer counts us back in and we start again, and i&#39;m thankful that for some reason every time we were going to end the song at the end of the night, the drummer would count us back in again, so that we played the end of the song like 5 or 6 times, each time the fact that we were playing it again feeling sillier and more wonderful. i&#39;m thankful to have felt in the moment like i could have done it for a very long time, but i&#39;m also thankful that it ended, because we all collapsed to the floor laughing uncontrollably. i&#39;m thankful for that kind of release and i&#39;m thankful to have expressed my gratitude to the drummer for delivering us to it.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have had a wonderful saturday too. i&#39;m thankful that after doing our grocery shopping for the week, d and i walked down the bike path to the distillery. i&#39;m thankful that though at first we had to sit at a picnic table in direct sun, which was too intense, eventually someone at an umbrella table left and we were able to take their table. i&#39;m thankful for the taco truck that parks at the distillery on the weekends and i&#39;m thankful for the delicious tacos (chorizo, carne asada, and al pastor) and fresh chips and salsa we had. i&#39;m thankful that i had a fancy cocktail from the distillery, even though i don&#39;t really drink much anymore and it fucked up my stomach, which is generally in good shape these days (i&#39;m thankful, after it being notable enough that i was always writing about it in the past, that. i&#39;m thankful that it was worth it, both because it tasted good and for the experience of sitting with d in the sunshine talking about nothing, which was perfect.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have vacuumed the house, which i hadn&#39;t done in a couple weeks out of laziness. i&#39;m thankful to have roasted more brussels sprouts. i&#39;m thankful to have done yoga. i&#39;m thankful to have messed around with my raspberry pi. i&#39;m thankful that though my stomach was messed up, i had a few bananas and a clementine for dinner and that was soothing and good. i&#39;m thankful to have bought hydrox cookies at the grocery store after reading <a href="http://kotaku.com/snacktaku-showdown-oreo-vs-hydrox-1794292689">this thought-provoking review</a> (my take: they&#39;re fine, but i prefer the way that oreos saturate with milk). i&#39;m thankful that d is making strawberry shortcakes tonight. i&#39;m thankful for apricot la croix.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that our vpn is working again and we were able to watch more <em>terrace house: aloha state</em>. i&#39;m thankful that afterwards, we watched part 1 of <em>o.j.: made in america</em>, which is incredible. i&#39;m thankful for the various striking juxtapositions of sound and image, of interview and stock footage, of reality and the fictions that make it up. i&#39;m thankful to look forward to watching more and also to watching <a href="https://fieldofvision.org/the-moderators">this short documentary about content moderation</a>. i&#39;m thankful that <em>the handmaiden</em>, which i really want to see, is now on amazon prime video. i&#39;m thankful to have played bass to the drum machine in my effects pedal for an hour and a half. i&#39;m thankful, even though i would have liked to go on a long bike ride or run, that today is going to be a rainy day, since there are nice things about rainy days too.</p>
