        <p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday, which was a difficult day, emotionally and physically, is over and that we are now in today.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that now, the third time, i have hopefully finally learned my lesson about pushing myself too hard with long bike rides. i&#39;m thankful that, despite a detour because of road construction and some crazy hills, my ride to the nearby town (20ish miles) was pleasant. i&#39;m thankful for how canopies of trees provide shade. i&#39;m thankful for breezes, both natural ones and the ones that are created by going fast on a bike. i&#39;m thankful for the times when i&#39;m going down a hill so fast i can&#39;t hear anything besides the rush of the air. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when i got to the town, which is a small kitschy tourist community near a local state park, i ate a footlong hotdog, a pulled pork sandwich, and drank a lemon-orange &quot;shake-up,&quot; which is, as far as i can tell, a mixture of lemon and orange juices with sugar syrup which is then shaken in a cup. i&#39;m thankful for how refreshing the shake-up was. i&#39;m thankful that the stand where i bought it also sold powerade, so i bought a bottle to refill my hydration backpack. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the hydration backpack, which worked really well until, as i started along the highway to get back, it started leaking, soaking my entire lower body and the back of my bike in red powerade. i&#39;m thankful that i eventually realized i couldn&#39;t fix it and stopped and dumped out the rest of the contents on the side of the highway. i&#39;m thankful for the man who stopped on the other side of the highway to ask me if i was okay and if i needed help. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that as i biked along the highway, over beautiful rolling forested hills that were only slightly tarnished by the traffic aggressively passing me, i became thirstier and thirstier (it was 90 degrees). i&#39;m thankful that sometimes i felt so tired i had to stop the bike, but that when i stopped the bike, i lost the feeling of breeze and was suddenly struck by the immensity of the heat. i&#39;m thankful for the desperate moment when i held my hydration pack over my head in order to get the sip of hot powerade that was left in there. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for how much willpower it took me to keep going through the country to get back to town and thankful that i had the strength to push through the discomfort and difficulty. i&#39;m thankful for how i was crying and how i had the presence of mind to wonder if crying would contribute significantly to my dehydration, even though i couldn&#39;t stop. i&#39;m thankful that i just kept trying to say encouraging things to myself, sometimes aloud, kept picturing in my mind how i would get to the edge of town and stop at the first fast food place or gas station and buy several very refreshing drinks. i&#39;m thankful for how happy i was to see the road sign marking the edge of the county limits. i&#39;m thankful for the brewster&#39;s ice cream stand, which was the first place i reached. i&#39;m thankful that my heart was beating rapidly and i felt faint and hot and i was worried i was going to pass out before i was able to order.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have experienced and survived the depth of the sadness i felt when i reached into the powerade soaked hydration backpack and could not find my credit card. i&#39;m thankful that i was beyond shame and sat down on the hot asphalt, pulling a waterlogged pack of gum and some energy bar wrappers and a package of crushed pop tarts but could not find my credit card. i&#39;m thankful that i walked up to the window of the brewster&#39;s, my face soaked with tears and sweat and melted sunscreen and powerade, and asked if i could please have a cup of water. i&#39;m thankful for the young employee, who said &quot;of course&quot; and immediately brought me a tall cup of ice water. i&#39;m thankful for that water, which was the best water i have ever tasted in my life. i&#39;m thankful that it gave me the energy to go the last few miles home.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for difficult days, because when we get through them it means something. i&#39;m thankful for the relief of the ordinary.</p>
