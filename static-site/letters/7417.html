        <p>i&#39;m thankful that when i scheduled my time off a few weeks ago, i decided to go back to work today, even though now i&#39;m kind of regretting it because d is off today and i still feel kind of wiped from our trip. i&#39;m thankful that i feel a little of the usual apprehension about going back to work but it&#39;s not that bad and i&#39;m thankful actually that it&#39;s a holiday today and a bunch of people are out, which will hopefully be helpful for me easing back into the flow of things. i&#39;m thankful that i checked my work email and i had some really lovely messages from my coworkers which made me feel very glad about my job. i&#39;m thankful that my awesome coworkers handled the tickets that were assigned to me while i was gone, which means i don&#39;t have any old ones in my queue to deal with to start the day, which is the best.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the nice people we showed the house we&#39;re living in to yesterday evening. i&#39;m thankful since our landlord didn&#39;t come because she had foot surgery, we were able to be more honest with them than we might have been otherwise, while still recommending the house (which is a place we&#39;ve generally enjoyed living). i&#39;m thankful we got our bags unpacked and i&#39;m thankful for the cleaning that d did before they came over. i&#39;m thankful to have done a load of laundry and that today i think i&#39;ll wash the sheets, since it&#39;s nice to have fresh sheets after a long trip. i&#39;m thankful to have facetimed with my parents after dinner last night. i&#39;m thankful for this picture of <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/882054575666188289">me with them when i was a child</a>. i&#39;m thankful that i love them very much and they love me very much.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d and i went back to watching the most recent season kardashians after a week off and it was great. i&#39;m thankful for how often home video footage from their childhoods has been incorporated into the show this season. i&#39;m thankful for how it seems like a kind of show before there was a show. i&#39;m thankful for video of kim and kourtney on a car trip doing large marge&#39;s monologue from <em>peewee&#39;s big adventure</em>, which was one of my family&#39;s favorite movies during my childhood. i&#39;m thankful the sisters finally visited the cabazon dinosaurs (i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://theawl.com/the-tetris-effect-d61d3339b7b8">this essay</a>, which also features a trip to the dinosaurs and which is probably the piece of non-thank-you-notes writing i&#39;m most proud of). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for kourt&#39;s struggles with a hotel door key card, which further underlines to me that she is my favorite. i&#39;m thankful for when khloe was mocking some unflattering shorts of hers and said &quot;but you <em>do</em> have a great ass&quot; and kourt said, annoyed to still be discussing the topic, &quot;i know, that&#39;s why i&#39;m not concerned.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that in palm springs the sisters play the heads up phone game and kim gets &quot;nick lachey&quot; and kourt says &quot;you went on a date to a movie theater with him&quot; and kim immediately guesses that it&#39;s nick lachey. i&#39;m thankful for khloe&#39;s story of getting her first period at their grandparents&#39; house in palm springs and how kris gave her a tampon instead of a pad, which was intimidating; i&#39;m thankful for the final scene of the episode, where kris, kourt, and kim discuss whether kris could still have a baby and kim says &quot;the ship has fucking sailed and it&#39;s in the bermuda triangle at the bottom of the ocean&quot; but is then touched when kris says that if she thought it would be safe, she would carry a baby for kim and kourt breaks the seriousness of the moment by saying &quot;i already offered myself so don&#39;t pretend you&#39;re the only mother theresa here.&quot;</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that we are eating big kardashian salads for dinner this week as our bodies recover from the indulgences of our vacation. i&#39;m thankful on my run yesterday afternoon for the little boy i saw bouncing up and down by the air conditioner exhaust as his mother gardened in another part of the yard. i&#39;m thankful to be typing these notes on my work computer after not having used it for a week—i&#39;m thankful for the feel of the keyboard under my fingers and the click of the keys as they&#39;re tapped. i&#39;m thankful for the way that in my mind typing and thinking are intertwined. i&#39;m thankful that i can use my fingers to translate what&#39;s inside my mind into a form where it can be stored and shared with you.</p>
