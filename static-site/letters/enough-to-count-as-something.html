        <p>i&#39;m thankful for korean food with d, k, t, ec, and v (<a href="https://www.gawker.com/culture/stop-calling-your-boyfriend-p-online">lol</a>) and learning a lot about <em>murder she wrote</em> from EC on the drive over. i&#39;m thankful that when i requested ssamjang (since they don&#39;t give it to you by default) the waitress asked &quot;do you want gochujang too&quot; and i said &quot;yes&quot; and she brought two big bowls of a very good ssamjang and then also a red plastic squirt bottle of gochujang, which had to be thinner than normal) in order to be squirted easily through the tiny nozzle (i&#39;m talking about a classic diner plastic ketchup/mustard bottle) and the ease of use led to me squeezing thin ribbons of it on everything including on a piece of cabbage kimchi i had in my chopsticks and ate and then looked up and saw ec across the table looking at me like david attenborough documentary and said &quot;i&#39;ve never seen anyone put gochujang on kimchi before&quot; and i had never done it before but i would do it again.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the bag of rainier cherries we have right now, which is (for me, if not for d) the perfect balance of tart and sweet.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i had cereal with blueberries and milk for breakfast. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s d and i&#39;s anniversary and i&#39;m thankful to love her more than anyone else in the world and that we get to spend our lives together and stuff. i&#39;m thankful for the theragun massage ball thing she got me, which i wedge into my hip sockets and put my whole body weight into, something i did in various positions on our living room floor while we listened to the new drake album. i&#39;m thankful to have recorded her a cover of &quot;late to the party&quot; by kacey musgraves. i&#39;m thankful that right now i&#39;m sitting across from her on the couch from her where she has fallen asleep sitting up with her computer in her lap, a thing i could not imagine happening to myself but that happens every day (i&#39;m thankful for the almost buddha-like image i have of her in my mind, that i have always romanticized her ease of sleep, which was one reason why the period of manic insomnia was so hard—i&#39;m thankful that neither of us have trouble sleeping anymore) and then a beat drop on the drake album kicked harder and she woke up and is back to clicking and tapping and swiping.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;ve basically (hopefully) wrapped the thing i&#39;ve been working on at work and will get to move on to something else and that the completion of this part will also help us be about to move to the next stage in a larger sense. i&#39;m thankful that what are hopefully the last parts of this current thing (writing some tests and then a visual fix to make it more responsive) turned out to not be as heavy as i thought they were going to be. i&#39;m thankful that i am more and more comfortable writing tests and even sometimes enjoy it (though i&#39;m also intrigued by the idea of switching our testing framework for one that would (in theory) be easier to work with).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374539184/everythingineedigetfromyou">everything i need i get from you,</a> which is such a good read (and would pair well with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Next-Level-Friendship-Almost-Giving/dp/161219446X">the next next level</a>, which i reread recently)(i&#39;m thankful also for the report in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/famous-people/">famous</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/famous-people/">people on c&#39;s party</a>). i&#39;m thankful for the drake album, which is very enjoyable; i&#39;m thankful for the extended instrumental passages and the range of the beats.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that all six of my miles today were under nine minutes and that it was sunny (but not so much that i needed sunglasses) and just warm enough (but not hot). i&#39;m thankful for listening to music while running, even though i get annoyed that i run better with it because intellectually i&#39;d often rather listen to a podcast, but i do like the idea that i need to be more intentional about listening to more music in order to give myself the variety i need. i&#39;m thankful for the new spotify &quot;enhanced playlist&quot; feature which i feel like works pretty well and is an actual good thing i am given by an app. i&#39;m thankful that i have been doing more planks and downward dog and just generally stretching.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that there are lots of other things i could think to write about given time but also i&#39;m thankful that i told myself if i wrote something for this rather than looking at my phone that i could eat dessert (ice cream i think) and i think this is enough to count as something.</p>
