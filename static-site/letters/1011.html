        <p>i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t have to go to work yesterday and i don&#39;t have to go to work today and then it&#39;s the weekend so i don&#39;t have to go to work those days either. i&#39;m thankful also that my last day at work before the long weekend was actually a good one, where i had my most fun recent development experience working on a new feature (thankful for react hooks) and got to have a fun pair session with my friend k, hopefully the first in a series. i&#39;m thankful for days that make me feel hopeful about work and to imagine the possibility of a future where i&#39;m excited at the beginning of every day.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though miso woke me up at my usual time yesterday and today, instead of lying in bed waiting for d to wake up, i came out to the living room and had my breakfast (i&#39;m thankful for dried sour cherries in steel cut oatmeal) and got in an early run on the treadmill. i&#39;m thankful that though we had a series of difficulties with the treadmill&#39;s tracking and belt tightness, complicated by a confusing interface for modifying those things in which using a hex wrench to screw a bolt in a particular direction could have multiple effects unexplained in the manual </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i am continuing to have the best treadmill runs i&#39;ve ever had since i introduced playing switch to the equation. i&#39;m thankful for tetris and mario kart, which have been my two go-to treadmill games lately, and i&#39;m thankful that s had the idea to get a cheap projector so d and i could project our screens against the basement wall while we go. i&#39;m thankful for podcasts i listen to while i run and play, especially (despite my hatred of numbers) the 538 politics podcast (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/">https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/</a>), which is my current favorite podcast, mostly because i like clare malone a lot and the interplay of the hosts is good.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday we bought delicious sandwiches (one with italian cured meats and one meatball parm) to go and went to a park in the north near a huge bridge and ate them at a picnic table with miso. i&#39;m thankful we walked across the huge bridge, even though in retrospect i would probably prefer not to walk across a huge bridge with a twitchy dog, and i&#39;m thankful for miso&#39;s excitement at walking up a steep ridge trail. i&#39;m thankful for the solidity of pleasant tiredness in legs after a good amount of running and hiking. i&#39;m thankful to have ordered popeye&#39;s delivery as a surprise for dinner.</p>
<p>i&#39;m so thankful we moved to portland and i&#39;m thankful for how hard d pushed for us to move, against my fear and resistance at the time, because i think that if i had my way, i probably would have let inertia take the wheel as i always do and would have stayed in bloomington forever and wouldn&#39;t have experienced how much nicer our lives would be here, full of new places to go and good restaurants and full of friends. i&#39;m thankful that at least a couple of times a week, i am struck, in the midst of my usual mental mumble, by the thought &quot;i am so glad we moved here.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that i feel like a newer/better version of myself than the version i was just a few months ago, more open to experiences than i used to be. i&#39;m thankful that kh is having a party tonight to celebrate her new job, even though i&#39;m sad i won&#39;t get to work with her anymore. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <em>trust exercise</em> by susan choi, which gives me great <em>barry</em> vibes, even thought i&#39;m reading it slowly because it can be so intense that sometimes i have to put it down. i&#39;m thankful for <em>will and testament</em>, which i finished since the last time i wrote to you and which is the best novel i&#39;ve read in some time. i&#39;m thankful for the most recent season of <em>peaky blinders</em>, where the use of &quot;war pigs&quot; as the soundtrack to an inevitable slow motion montage of people walking toughly led to the realization that <em>peaky blinders</em> is like &quot;what if a sabbath riff was also a TV show,&quot; which is an aesthetic i&#39;m into, especially when the plot of the season is about tricking and then killing fascists. i&#39;m thankful we started a rewatch of <em>the good place</em> yesterday. i&#39;m thankful for the movie <em>first man</em>, which was overly long but had some fun rumbly shaky-cam setpieces that made me think of &quot;what if <em>friday night lights</em> but NASA in the 60s.&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to be listening to the new <em>big thief</em> album on headphones as i sit in our front room in my bathrobe and covered with another blanket. i&#39;m thankful to have decided on my lazy halloween costume thanks to a tip from ew, which is that i&#39;m going to go as self care and wear a robe and slippers and a korean face mask. i&#39;m thankful that i have cut out a lot of the expensive supplements i used to take and have not really experienced any problems because of that, in some ways i actually feel better. i&#39;m thankful to keep taking ones that i think are good for me somehow. i&#39;m thankful to have written this, which feels like its own kind of supplement and is free.</p>
