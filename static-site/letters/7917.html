      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that at the beginning of the weekend, i stuck my work computer under a pile of jeans in my closet and put my personal computer on my desk in its place. i&#39;m thankful to force myself to not look at and (to try to) not think about work in this way. i&#39;m thankful for the privilege of owning two good computers. i&#39;m thankful for the difference in this computer, which has a much squishier and more satisfying keyboard than my newer work computer. i&#39;m thankful that though the screen is smaller, it&#39;s big enough to do the things i need to do on it. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the walk d and i took yesterday. i&#39;m thankful that unlike most of our walks, which are too long, this one was just right. i&#39;m thankful rather than going south or east as we usually do, we went north, which was quieter and offered more shade. i&#39;m thankful for the raspberry soda we shared, which had been sitting in the fridge for a long time and was blessedly cold. i&#39;m thankful for our discussions of work, which are valuable, and for our discussion of what people at d&#39;s company (and my former company) would be what game of thrones characters. i&#39;m thankful for exercises like this, for the way that these external frameworks, applied out of context, can help us to see the familiar in new ways.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/APEntertainment/status/882997198602084352">this amazingly me AP correction</a>. i&#39;m thankful to flash back literally a decade to the beginning of my blogging &quot;career&quot;, where everything i wrote was in some way related to the reality television show the hills, including <a href="https://songsaboutbuildingsandfood.wordpress.com/2008/02/17/songs-that-should-be-on-the-hills-part-1/">this post</a> about one of my favorite albums, lauryn hill&#39;s <em>unplugged</em>. i&#39;m thankful that the album and my writing about it doesn&#39;t really have much to do with the show, but i&#39;m thankful that at the time i found the device of always writing about the show and viewing things through the lens of it to be useful and rewarding. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the breakdown i experienced after a long time doing this, when i suddenly found the lens limiting (since it felt like the things i wrote, because they depended on this external context, weren&#39;t really <em>mine</em>) and decided to try to do different things. i&#39;m thankful to empathize with <a href="http://kotaku.com/top-minecraft-youtuber-quits-channel-because-he-doesnt-1796727425">this person</a> for that reason and to wonder if someday i will come to feel this way about writing my thank you notes, that the form is too limiting or repetitive or that i just can&#39;t do it anymore. i&#39;m thankful to hope not, that this is different, and i&#39;m thankful that this <em>feels</em> different, that the limitations here are freeing, that i feel like in this space i can do whatever i want to do (but without the fear of not knowing how to do that, since i always know how each sentence will start, which means the ball is always rolling and i am just following it).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, appropriately, that we finished watching the current season of <em>keeping up with the kardashians</em> on friday night. i&#39;m thankful, since the finale was built around rob kardashian&#39;s thirtieth birthday party, for my sudden horrified realization that i am older than rob kardashian. i&#39;m thankful that the season&#39;s theme of motherhood reached its real apotheosis with kim&#39;s evisceration of catelyn&#39;s memoir and its portrayal of kris as a mother and wife and its ridiculous apotheosis when khloe talked about wanting to get pregnant not (primarily) because she wanted a child but because she wanted to do a line of maternity jeans at good american. i&#39;m thankful to have learned that kendall has a tracy emin neon sculpture above her bed, which is by far the most interesting thing i have ever learned about kendall. i&#39;m thankful for the final montage where, over slow motion montages of the season, the characters voice-overed about their feelings, which could have been cheezy but thanks to being soundtracked by kanye&#39;s &quot;waves&quot; was actually kind of moving, like yearbook signatures they&#39;re leaving for you before everyone goes away for the summer.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for a moment i thought of when d and i were walking yesterday and drinking the raspberry soda, which was in a glass bottle with a cap that didn&#39;t twist and required a bottle opener. i&#39;m thankful to have suddenly flashed back to my senior year of high school in florida, where upperclassmen had the privilege of leaving school at lunch. i&#39;m thankful that though i didn&#39;t have any friends, i was still grateful for this, since it meant that instead of sitting in the quad or lunchroom by myself and feeling ugly and alone, i could go on a walk by myself and feel peaceful solitude. i&#39;m thankful that i tried to find side streets where none of my classmates would see me and was mostly successful. i&#39;m thankful that the halfway point of my walks was a convenience store called <em>eight till late</em> where i would buy a soda or a candy bar for &quot;lunch&quot; on my walk home. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that one day, trying to treat myself after a morning in which i didn&#39;t have too many panic attacks, i bought one of those jarritos mexican sodas in the glass bottles from the refrigerated case in the back of the store. i&#39;m thankful that when i brought it to the cashier and bought it, she asked if i&#39;d like for her to open it for me. i&#39;m thankful that awkward and not understanding, i said no, that i was fine (which was always my answer to any question about how i was, that i was fine, even though i was often very not fine). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, fifteen seconds after leaving the store and starting back to school, to have realized that the reason she had offered to open the bottle is because it didn&#39;t twist off and so i couldn&#39;t get it open. i&#39;m thankful to know that while now i would just have gone back to the store and asked for it to be opened, that felt, like so many things in life, impossible. i&#39;m thankful that what i instead decided was that perhaps i could get the bottle opened by knocking the top of it against the concrete back wall of the strip mall the convenience store was in. i&#39;m thankful that of course this was a dumb idea and left me with a jagged edge around the neck of the broken bottle, my hands covered with sticky green liquid. i&#39;m thankful that, desperate to salvage this situation but knowing i couldn&#39;t touch my lips to the broken bottle. i tried to stick out my tongue and pour the soda onto it from a &quot;safe&quot; distance before realizing this was futile and leaving the broken bottle in the scraggly grass and heading back to school, thirsty.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have recalled this story on a beautiful saturday morning as i walked with a person who loves me and who i love down shady quiet streets, past people working in their gardens and children playing aimlessly. i&#39;m thankful that i told her the story and we laughed and then kept walking into the future.</p>
