        <p>i&#39;m thankful for a nice sunday. i&#39;m thankful that in the morning i worked on a challenging but rewarding personal project and did some intensive yoga and meditated. i&#39;m thankful to have had a bowl of sauteed chickpeas and a fuji apple for lunch. i&#39;m thankful that in the afternoon, it was warm and sunny outside and i went for my first longer run of the year. i&#39;m thankful to have chosen a quieter path than the trail i normally use, which i knew would be filled with other people out for one of the first tastes of spring. i&#39;m thankful for the way running and walking distances around the town over the time we&#39;ve lived there has resulted in a kind of mental map i can use to tell where i am and an augmented sense of direction. i&#39;m thankful to know this place in my body.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to feel quite sore today all through my body, especially in my right foot, the sides of my but, the sides of my upper arm, and my thighs. i&#39;m thankful to feel quite sore today, even though it&#39;s not nice to feel sore, because being sore means that i pushed my body in a way that it hadn&#39;t been pushed recently. i&#39;m thankful, still, to hope that i feel less sore later. i&#39;m thankful that though i get sore sometimes, my body generally responds well to the kind of exercise that i choose to do, which isn&#39;t true of everyone and which is a blessing. i&#39;m thankful that i have time to exercise every day if i choose to and i&#39;m thankful every day to make that choice.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful last night to have made us portobello &quot;burgers&quot; with avocado and raw onion and mustard and american cheese and baked sweet potato &quot;fries&quot; (which i cut into pretty decent shoestrings but didn&#39;t get hot enough to get a good crispiness on most of them). i&#39;m thankful that though these food items were in quotation marks, the kind that indicate failed representations of a better original, they were still tasty and satisfying. i&#39;m thankful for sriracha mixed with ketchup. i&#39;m thankful for the orange that we had as a palate cleanser—i&#39;m thankful for the thick rind of navel oranges, which makes them easy and satisfying to peel, and i&#39;m thankful for the way when you rip open the feels orange oil sprays into the air around your hands.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.howsweeteats.com/2016/04/chocolate-tres-leches-cake/">the chocolate tres leches cake</a> that d made for our dessert. i&#39;m thankful for how impossibly moist and sweet and rich the cake is. i&#39;m thankful that i tried to cut us more reasonable portions than i would normally cut from a cake. i&#39;m thankful that when looking up the blog that recipe, the top autocomplete result was <a href="http://www.howsweeteats.com/2015/02/lactation-cookies/">this recipe</a>, which i couldn&#39;t help but look at. i&#39;m thankful that on the way home from my run, i stopped at the grocery store and got whipped cream to go on top of the cake. i&#39;m thankful to understand that you might think a cake with three milks would not need to have whipped cream on top, but i&#39;m thankful to tell you that you&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d built herself some shelves for her clothes, which helped us to organize and de-clutter our bedroom, which with the new space that created feels like a new space. i&#39;m thankful to have vacuumed the house, which always makes it feel nicer to be in. i&#39;m thankful that it didn&#39;t take me very long to pack up the recyclables and i&#39;m thankful that i did it yesterday so that i don&#39;t have to do it today. i&#39;m thankful that though it&#39;s going to rain today, i don&#39;t have to leave the house except to take the trash and recyclables down to the street. i&#39;m thankful that i will take the time to find the batteries i need for my keyboard and trackpad so that i can stand up while working today, which will hopefully make me feel less lethargic at the end of the day.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to feel like today&#39;s notes are kind of boring, but i&#39;m thankful that the ritual of writing the notes is more important to me than whether they are interesting to read. i&#39;m thankful to know that even if these notes are boring, i will eventually (probably not too far from now) come to a day where i write notes that i think are more interesting and i just need to be patient. i&#39;m thankful to know that these notes are like exercise, in that they grant me both long-term tangible benefits (the creation of a body of work, the sculpting of a body) but also immediate tangible benefits (sanity at the base level and if i&#39;m lucky a sense of peace that will hang on with me through some of the rest of the day).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for this episode of <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-our-time/id73330895?mt=2">in our time</a></em> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai">hokusai</a>. i&#39;m thankful that hokusai drew and painted and printed thousands of images over the course of his life, that his goal was to represent everything. i&#39;m thankful to have learned the story of how hokusai was invited to the court of the shogun to &quot;<em>compete with another artist who practiced more traditional brush stroke painting. Hokusai&#39;s painting, created in front of the Shogun, consisted of painting a blue curve on paper, then chasing across it a chicken whose feet had been dipped in red paint. He described the painting to the Shogun as a landscape showing the Tatsuta River with red maple leaves floating in it, winning the competition.</em>&quot; i&#39;m thankful for abstraction and i&#39;m thankful for action.</p>
