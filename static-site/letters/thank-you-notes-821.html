      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that when i got up from reading a magazine on the couch yesterday afternoon, i looked out into our overgrown backyard and saw our landlord&#39;s cleaning and maintenance person standing there, looking at her phone. i&#39;m thankful that our landlord had emailed us earlier in the day about getting us a new (used) range since ours is broken, but had said &quot;not sure about delivery times,&quot; which i took to mean maybe sometime next week. i&#39;m thankful that m, the cleaning and maintenance person, is a very nice person and thankful that she had stopped to drop off the oven, which was at the edge of the back of a u-haul in the alley behind our house. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though the oven was very heavy, d and i, with a little help from m, were able to get it out of the truck and down the stairs into our yard, through the mudroom (i&#39;m thankful it fit through the door) and into the kitchen. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t have the proper wrench to unscrew the oven&#39;s hose from the gas line, since i did not really know what i was doing anyway. i&#39;m thankful (i guess) that our landlord is coming over with a proper wrench tomorrow, even though i know the phrase &quot;<em>we can do it ourselves</em>&quot; in her email means &quot;_you will do it, justin, while i watch, because i do not want to pay for a professiona_l.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for how her email ignored d&#39;s question &quot;<em>what should we do with the old oven?</em>&quot; which probably means that d and i will be hauling it through the mudroom and up the stairs and down the alley and into the garage. i&#39;m thankful to feel nostalgic for c, the maintenance man for our old apartment building. i&#39;m thankful that though moving an additional oven through a rainy day and into the kitchen messed up the floor i had cleaned on friday, it didn&#39;t take long to get it cleaned again. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <em>blond(e)</em>,  which i am listening to on speakers on the couch in the living room and which is really incredibly beautiful so far and which i can imagine myself listening to many times happily into the future. i&#39;m thankful when things are worth the wait. i&#39;m thankful to have spent $10 on it. i&#39;m thankful i didn&#39;t buy <em>no man&#39;s sky,</em> another long-awaited cultural product: i&#39;m thankful it makes other people happy, even though it didn&#39;t do anything for me in the few hours i played it this weekend after renting it at redbox. i&#39;m thankful for the most recent issue of n+1, which i read half of yesterday in a lukewarm bath. i&#39;m thankful for sarah nicole prickett&#39;s essay on &quot;<a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-26/politics/the-stanford-letters/">the stanford letters</a>,&quot; which made me uncomfortable but in an interesting way. i&#39;m thankful for essays that aren&#39;t obvious and that aren&#39;t afraid not to hold your hand.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful also for holding hands. i&#39;m thankful for this <a href="https://twitter.com/Niall__Campbell/status/767034575860199424">poem</a>. i&#39;m thankful that andre 3000 just appeared, double-timing against dissonance and then disappearing into a present silence. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/kitlovelace/status/767024287287050240">this map</a> of &quot;maps.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that though i haven&#39;t been able to settle on what book i want to read next, i&#39;ve flitted in and out of some nice things, which feels dilletanteish and summery and which i&#39;m okay with. i&#39;m thankful for the container of a dozen krispy kreme donuts i bought at the supermarket, even though they weren&#39;t (couldn&#39;t) be as good as i wanted them to be. i&#39;m thankful to remember how there was always a long line at the krispy kreme in the underground mall off the subway station in korea. i&#39;m thankful to remember when d and i were in north carolina and my dad bought us donuts and we ate them on a hotel bed while watching cable tv: i&#39;m thankful i had told him only to get a few but that he came back with many. i&#39;m thankful for the concept of a baker&#39;s dozen. i&#39;m thankful for the word &quot;extra.&quot;</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though my tire went flat on my bike ride this morning, it went flat early in the ride, when i was still within (long) walking distance of home, rather than out in the country. i&#39;m thankful it was a beautiful day today and not too hot. i&#39;m thankful that when i was going up a hill before my tire went flat (i&#39;m thankful i mistyped that as &quot;before my time went flat&quot;), i looked up into the blue sky and saw the moon. i&#39;m thankful whenever that phenomenon happens, for the magic surprise of it. i&#39;m thankful that in the moment, walking my bike, i pushed myself toward gratitude that i was getting to walk through a cool breeze beautiful day, that there was nothing wrong or bad about this. i&#39;m thankful that it wasn&#39;t that hard to push myself into this, even as the edges of pedals of my bike scratched my calves or my shoulder ached from the awkward position i was putting it in to walk my bike. i&#39;m thankful for the garage i walked by where a dad was listening to &quot;bohemian rhapsody.&quot;</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i got home in time to make d fried eggs and hashbrowns for lunch. i&#39;m thankful to remember how when we were in grad school, i made us eggs and toast for breakfast every day, which was nice, and i&#39;m thankful that now we eat cereal in bed, which is nice in its own way. i&#39;m thankful that i had a protein shake and some fruit, since i am not a big fan of big savory breakfasts. i&#39;m thankful for how gleeful she was at the supermarket to buy wavy lays to go with our chili dogs. i&#39;m thankful for the saltiness of those chips and of the morton&#39;s i bought for my neti pot. i&#39;m thankful for nectarines and thankful for bananas. i&#39;m thankful for raisins and thankful for coconut almond honeybush tea. i&#39;m thankful for organs and electric pianos, for plinks and hums and strums.</p>
