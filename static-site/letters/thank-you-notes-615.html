        <p>i&#39;m thankful my mom texted me this morning after her run to thank me for &quot;fostering a love of running&quot; in her. i&#39;m thankful to remember the summer after college when she and i were living in the house my parents were trying to sell and in the evenings when jacksonville beach cooled off a little, we would go out into the neighborhood, she on her bike and me running. i&#39;m thankful to remember coming home afterward and drinking a cold miller high life (my beer of choice at the time) at the kitchen table. i&#39;m thankful for that kitchen table, which was the site of many happy meals. i&#39;m thankful to remember one night very carefully peeling a tangerine and laying the slices around the rim of a small white plate which had a small reservoir in the center, which i filled with honey. i&#39;m thankful to remember the thanksgiving</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for how strange it feels that the heat here seems to peak in the evening rather than the early afternoon. i&#39;m thankful, after i resigned myself to not taking any more baths until next fall, to have rediscovered how nice cool and room temperature baths can be. i&#39;m thankful for the first cool bath i can remember taking solace in, which was when i helped move into the house i lived in the senior year of college with my dumb roommate a who had not gotten the electricity turned on for the house we were moving into despite it being florida in august. i&#39;m thankful that d bought me fancy bath salts and incense mentioned in <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/05/bloop-guide-to-summer-parties.html">the bloop guide to summer parties</a>. i&#39;m thankful for the bath bombs that d&#39;s sister e bought her because they were on her etsy wishlist, not knowing that d doesn&#39;t take baths, and how this led to e learning the story of how i picked her engagement ring out from her pinterest, only to find out that it was not actually a ring she wanted.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that even though i had a panic attack in the waiting room at the doctor&#39;s office, when the nurse took my blood pressure, it was normal and healthy, which it almost never is at the doctor&#39;s office. i&#39;m thankful to have gotten through the ordeal i had to go through to log into my health insurance website yesterday, in which i had to request a temporary password because i had forgotten my real password but then the form you submitted once you logged in with the temporary password to enter a new real password was broken and threw an error message asking me to call customer care when i clicked the submit button. i&#39;m thankful that after sitting on hold with customer care for a while, i got to a person, who, when i told her my issue, made an &quot;<em>oh, honey</em>&quot; sound with her voice and told me i actually needed to talk to tech support and not customer care for that. i&#39;m thankful for the tech support guy, who reset my password administratively and thankful that i only had to have him repeat it like 4 times before i was able to get it right (i&#39;m thankful for the new episode of <a href="http://www.feralaudio.com/72-d-as-in-duh/">call chelsea peretti</a>, in which she does several hilarious extended riffs on the particular contemporary anxiety of having to clarify the letters in words over the phone (&quot;<em>a as in aardvark, b as in biscotti</em>&quot;)).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that once i did all that to get logged in to the health insurance website, i couldn&#39;t find where to submit an appeal a denied claim, which was the whole reason i needed to log in. i&#39;m thankful that i am a rational person, and so i assumed it might be somewhere on the &quot;claims&quot; page, or, if not there, on the &quot;services&quot; page, but it was not. i&#39;m thankful that googling &quot;anthem appeal claim&quot; directed me to a number of pages that mentioned that i could appeal a claim online without actually linking to the page where you appeal the claim. i&#39;m thankful that after an extensive search, i finally found that there was a very small link in the &quot;message center&quot; page to a form where i could file an appeal and that i was able to do so. i&#39;m thankful that d reminded me of the concept of &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi1hPOZ1qrNAhVGRlIKHc_0B2kQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdarkpatterns.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNHXa8TXH02OxvS9nGZWyZas2CXtMQ&sig2=IB0hFnjE9TVY_T03kufv9A&bvm=bv.124272578,d.aXo">dark patterns</a>,&quot; though i think this might just be an unintentionally &quot;dim&quot; pattern, though maybe that&#39;s too charitable. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that a staff member from another office who found out how hot it is in our office brought over a fan to help us funnel in air from the cooler hallway. i&#39;m thankful that the faculty member with whom i have the closest relationship gave me a treasure chest full of chocolates like the one he keeps on his desk in his office for his coworkers so that i could put it on my desk in my new office to help me make friends with my new coworkers; i&#39;m thankful he signed the attached card &quot;<em>be happy</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for how happy my brother was that i could give him our parents&#39; hbo go password so he could watch the latest episode of game of thrones. i&#39;m thankful for the joyful slap echo chugging guitar of the song &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTWenElxJ8">leather jacket</a>&quot; by thunderbitch and the al green EQ of the alabama shakes song &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPnonYHS_IY">guess who</a>.&quot;</p>
