        <p>i&#39;m thankful for the unexpected and uncharacteristically sweet text i received from t this morning while packing for the journey home from my week-long work trip. i&#39;m thankful for the timing of the message, which i received moments before my phone turned off suddenly and inexplicably. i&#39;m thankful i had a safe trip home. i&#39;m thankful for my phone company&#39;s customer support representative, who is now checking the warranty on my phone, which hasn&#39;t turned on since this morning. i&#39;m thankful mercury is currently in retrograde, which i enjoy blaming tech-related mishaps like this on.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the many hours i&#39;ve already sank into trying to fix this problem myself today instead of doing something more reasonable like unpacking or going to bed early. i&#39;m thankful i&#39;m a person who is not only good at troubleshooting, but who enjoys the challenge of finding a solution to a problem through a long, annoyingly persistent process of experimentation. i&#39;m thankful for the strange mix of science and wizardry that troubleshooting software/hardware involves, including in this particular case everything from briefly leaving my phone in the freezer to what one blogger called _&quot;the sacred incanation [sic] of holding POWER and Volume Down at the same time, selecting Recovery Mode, then holding POWER while tapping Volume Up.&quot;_</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the apologetic tone of the customer support representative i&#39;m typing to over online chat, even if the interaction feels a bit rigid and robotic. i&#39;m thankful to not feel very hopeful about where this interaction is going but to do it anyway because i would really like a working phone again soon. i&#39;m thankful my experience doing customer support at a company that excels at it has made me a much kinder and more understanding person when i&#39;m the one needing a resolution to a frustrating problem.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful during moments of sudden data loss to remember i rely on many cloud services to store my digital belongings and that the only important thing on my phone that isn&#39;t backed up elsewhere is many months of photos and videos i&#39;ve taken. i&#39;m thankful for instagram, where a small sliver of my favorite images from the last year and a half still exist.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that even though i don&#39;t have access to any of my own photos from this past week, j sent me a few earlier that made me smile. i&#39;m thankful other people at our company retreat took lots of photos. i&#39;m thankful to hope that some of the photos include me and that i like the way i look in them. i&#39;m thankful to occasionally indulge my own vanity.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the hoarseness of my voice, which reveals how much more i talked this past week than i normally do (and how loudly i sang both in front of and with so many of my coworkers on saturday at the karaoke night i organized).</p>
<p>i&#39;m very thankful for my work friends. i&#39;m especially grateful for my friendship with j and the many hours we spent together in person after months of communicating via lines of text. i&#39;m thankful for the somewhat rare joy of making new friends as a grown-up.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful the ancient greeks developed a language that distinguishes between many more different types of love than english does. i&#39;m thankful for the greek word _philia_, which refers specifically to the feeling of love between friends. i&#39;m thankful to have felt this love and camaraderie at many points and with many people throughout the past week. i&#39;m thankful to think of love as a renewable resource and to believe i have a lot of it and a lot of different kinds of it to give.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that after several hours of troubleshooting, my phone successfully turned on long enough for me to swiftly upload my photos from the past week to a safe place. i&#39;m thankful for the very last image i took, which is a stitched together &quot;photo sphere&quot; of a handful of my beloved coworker-friends sitting at a sunny table on a patio near a large swimming pool.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that even though my phone is out of warranty, </p>
<p>i received the following message from the support representative i&#39;ve been chatting with: _&quot;Wow! I&#39;ve checked this with my specialist and convinced him. I&#39;m happy to inform you that I&#39;ll replace the device as one time exception for you and I also help you with the free next day shipping. so that you can get the device very soon.&quot;_</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful they had some good news to deliver me (for their sake and mine). i&#39;m thankful that good customer service is not just about the words used, but in the actions they represent. i&#39;m thankful my new phone is scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. i&#39;m thankful to be receiving a new phone for free, since mine is in pretty bad shape from dropping it countless times without a case on it. i&#39;m thankful for fresh starts and the promise they hold, even when they feel unwanted and ill-timed. i&#39;m thankful for shiny new gadgets.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to be home after a fun but exhausting week away. i&#39;m thankful to feel unsure of how i&#39;ll wake up tomorrow morning without a working phone to set an alarm on. i&#39;m thankful i&#39;m about to go to sleep in my own bed.</p>
