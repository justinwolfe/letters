        <p>i&#39;m thankful that today is my last day at this job. i&#39;m thankful that yesterday was perhaps the busiest craziest day we have had in a while, which is really saying something and which made me feel happier about leaving. i&#39;m thankful for the care package of homemade chocolate treats that my coworker sent me as a goodbye present. i&#39;m thankful for all of it, but especially the toffee covered with almonds, which is my favorite. i&#39;m thankful that i was supposed to have an onboarding call with a new client but he didn&#39;t show up, which gave me some &quot;extra&quot; time to answer other messages that was helpful. i&#39;m thankful that my favorite coworker is off today for her birthday but said she was going to get online so she could say a proper goodbye and i told her that the best gift she could give me would be not looking at her computer on her day off, so we went ahead and said goodbye/aloha yesterday.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that tomorrow we are going to knoxville to visit d&#39;s work bfff. i&#39;m thankful that i am not particularly looking forward to this, but i&#39;m thankful to know that it will probably be fine and might even be fun. i&#39;m thankful that we are only going to stay for one night because neither of us likes long visits. i&#39;m thankful they have a puppy, which will make d very happy in and of itself. i&#39;m thankful to hope that we can avoid getting into a bitter fight about politics (they are republicans, he thinks and feels bile rising in his throat) and can have a nice time together. i&#39;m thankful to hope that neither of them uses the phrase &quot;<em>socially liberal, but fiscally conservative</em>&quot; because i do not think i will be able to prevent myself angrily snorting if they do. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d has found a way to maintain a friendship that is sustaining and enriching and valuable with someone with very different beliefs than she has, which i find impressive and which is good. i&#39;m thankful to like her work bff as a person too and that we had lots of fun conversations together at our last team reunion (before the election). i&#39;m thankful that i think we are going to go to some wineries on our afternoon together. i&#39;m thankful that though i can&#39;t really drink that much anymore, there are other ways to have fun and i can still have tastes of things. i&#39;m thankful that my stomach has been pretty good lately, despite various stresses.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the discussion in the <em>terrace house</em> panel about why women get haircuts after breakups and for the pseudo-mystical comment that one panelist made that it&#39;s because &quot;<em>the feelings linger in the ends of the hair</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that we realized that the next season of terrace house has (mostly) the same cast and so we have many more episodes to watch. i&#39;m thankful we were both very tired from work last night and so ordered a pizza. i&#39;m thankful for mushrooms and onions and pepperoni. i&#39;m thankful that sometimes i put fish sauce on pizza, which i know is obscene, and often sriracha, which adds a nice spice. i&#39;m thankful that though most of the snow melted, there is still a bit of it left.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that we don&#39;t have band practice this week, even though i wanted to have one to build on the momentum of last week&#39;s practice. i&#39;m thankful to have been practicing by myself solo and to feel that i&#39;m getting better at playing bass. i&#39;m thankful for the interesting changes in muscle memory that have to take place after playing guitar for so many years because of the different length of the frets. i&#39;m thankful for the physical sensation of holding down a bass string with my left hand&#39;s fingers and sounding it with my right hand&#39;s fingers. i&#39;m thankful to have been stretching out my hands so i can reach more frets. i&#39;m thankful for the looper function on my effects pedal and for the built-in drum machine.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that today is friday and then i will have a whole week off before starting my new job the next monday. i&#39;m thankful to have plans of things i want to do, which include: meditating and doing yoga every day, cooking a new recipe, getting my bike fixed, finishing and releasing the web app i&#39;ve been working on, playing more with node and with my raspberry pi, playing a new videogame (maybe <em>stardew valley</em>, maybe <em>dishonored 2</em>), going on a nice long run, and doing some homework to hopefully prep a bit for my new job. i&#39;m thankful that today is friday, i&#39;m thankful that today is friday, i&#39;m thankful that today is friday.</p>
