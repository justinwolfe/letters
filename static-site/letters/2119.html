        <p>i&#39;m thankful that i only had to wait like an hour and a half at the DMV yesterday to finally get my oregon ID. i&#39;m thankful that i had the privilege of a day where i didn&#39;t have to work so i could go handle that and do my waiting without having to worry about getting back to work. i&#39;m thankful, even though i could have done this after starting my job anyway because i am a privileged knowledge worker, to have gone ahead and done it so i wouldn&#39;t put it off forever which i definitely might have.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the mobile game <em>void tyrant</em>, which i played on my phone while waiting and which, while it&#39;s less strategic and more chance based than my beloved <em>slay the spire,</em> still hits some of that simple interface roguelite sweet spot (i&#39;m also thankful that _slay the spire&#39;_s mobile version is in its final QA stage and should come out soon).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the employees at the DMV who appreciated that i was prepared and who were efficient, kind, and helpful. i&#39;m thankful to know how hard it can be in a high volume customer service position with lots of disgruntled customers to hit those grace notes, and so to appreciate it even more</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that it was 60 degrees yesterday and there was only the briefest hint of rain, which made for a comfortable bike ride to the DMV. i&#39;m thankful for my bike, which is light and comfortable. i&#39;m thankful for the extra exercise added to my day, which is always a good thing. i&#39;m thankful for the long north south streets here which i can use to get from our neighborhood up north to everywhere else and have thick and comfortable bike lanes. i&#39;m thankful for the variety of environments, built and natural, that i can experience on a relatively short trip.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the street cart tacos i got near the DMV after getting my temporary ID, since even though there was nothing notable about them, they were warm and filling and hit the spot. i&#39;m thankful that though the cart was embedded in a pod and there was no seating, i found a defunct cart on the other side of the parking lot with an open railing to eat from. i&#39;m thankful that though it started to sprinkle a little while i was eating, it never really rained. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for this recipe for meatballs in a coconut milk broth i made last night (</p>
<p><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020631-thai-inspired-chicken-meatball-soup">https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020631-thai-inspired-chicken-meatball-soup</a>) was, on a base level, edible and relatively satisfying over a bowl of rice, even though i probably wouldn&#39;t make it again because a) the meatballs did not hold together well, so i ended up just breaking them down into a hash (which was fine, but different than what we were expecting and b) the flavors just weren&#39;t that interesting or powerful, which makes sense and was something i was kind of anticipating based on the ingredient list but i hoped the sum would be more than the parts and c) i added too much fish sauce in a last minute desperate drive to add flavor. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, having had to grate a lot of ginger, to have been reminded of how much better it is too freeze the ginger first. i&#39;m thankful for our dutch oven and for wooden spoons and for ladles.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that <em>the magicians</em> is back and is as good as ever. i&#39;m thankful that last night we finished watching <em>the good place</em>, which was moving, even though SPOILER ALERT i really have trouble identifying with the idea of once and for all being &quot;done&quot; with heaven even if i get the concept intellectually.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though i have to pack for my onboarding trip to boston tomorrow, i&#39;ll get that done with and it won&#39;t take me that long. i&#39;m thankful that we have a washer and dryer and i&#39;m thankful that they&#39;re in our basement, even if it&#39;s sometimes annoying to ferry loads back and forth and up and down. i&#39;m thankful for the feeling of clothes warm from the dryer.  </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have found a new way to get miso to hold still while i dry her off from being out in our wet muddy backyard, which is to take a treat out of the bag and put it on the corner of my standing desk, visible but out of her reach, which distracts her as i vigorously towel her.</p>
