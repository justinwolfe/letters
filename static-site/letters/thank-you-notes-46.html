        <p>i&#39;m thankful that the package from amazon that was supposed to be delivered yesterday was not delivered yesterday (i&#39;m thankful for my hope that it will be delivered today). i&#39;m thankful that i put on my shoes and walked around the perimeter of the house to make sure the person who made the delivery hadn&#39;t just put it somewhere else like it said to do on the ups website, even though i was sure that the package wouldn&#39;t be there. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t urgently need any of the items from the package (even if i had been looking forward to them) and thankful for the nice customer service person on the phone, v, who helped me make a record of my undelivered but marked as delivered package. i&#39;m thankful for the weird rhythmic background sound in our call that was like a creepy form of beatboxing which i think from spy movies was maybe a sign of the call being recorded. i&#39;m thankful as a customer service person to be nice to other customer service people and thankful that being a customer service person has made me feel less anxious and self-conscious about talking on the phone to other customer service people than i was when i was younger. i&#39;m thankful that my calls at work aren&#39;t monitored or recorded (though i&#39;m thankful for the faculty member who used to have his office near me and who would, if i was floundering or giving out incorrect information on the phone, quickly write down the right answer on a post-it note and bring it over to me). i&#39;m thankful, finally, that my package was not delivered yesterday if only for the beginning of the email i got from amazon customer service after i got off the phone, which read: &quot;<em>Hello, I&#39;m sorry to hear your Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bag didn&#39;t arrive by the guaranteed delivery</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful to be reminded that many of my problems are not really problems, even when i let them feel like problems.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday afternoon i had a bad interaction with a master&#39;s student who i normally have lovely bantery chats with. i&#39;m thankful that she told me she couldn&#39;t get into the graduate student office and thankful at her smile when i leapt up gleefully and said i could help her out. i&#39;m thankful that she thanked me for my help and we went to my manager&#39;s office for the spare key and thankful for the moment, when she reached out her hand for the key, and i told her, &quot;<em>oh, no, i&#39;ll go with you--i can let you in, but i can&#39;t give you the key</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful how she immediately looked down and began walking away from me and how her voice, when she spoke, had dropped several semitones and hsharp edges. i&#39;m thankful to see (if i want to be uncharitable, as i first felt in the moment) the other side of people that you sometimes get when you don&#39;t give them exactly what they want or (if i want to be more charitable, which i normally do), the physical manifestation of her feeling vulnerable and embarrassed to have asked me something and gotten turned down. i&#39;m thankful she told me that she had checked out the key before from my boss several times before, that it hadn&#39;t been an issue, that she really needed, and thankful that i paused to consider it and then just said &quot;<em>ok, i don&#39;t really care</em>&quot; and gave her the key. i&#39;m thankful that this was fine and that i probably should&#39;ve just done it from the start since it wasn&#39;t a big deal and i don&#39;t really care about the rules very much, but also thankful to have asserted myself and said &quot;<em>no</em>&quot; at first, which is something that can be hard to do in customer service even though sometimes that.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i ran into the student this morning and it seemed we were back to our normal pleasant banter. i&#39;m thankful that in conversation she revealed to me that this cool old abandoned mill on the south side of town which d and i thought we were trespassing on when we found it with our bikes is actually a public park space where they are holding a local beer festival in a few weeks. i&#39;m thankful that at the end of our conversation, she asked me, as she has several times in the past few weeks, if i have yet bought or am going to buy my ticket for the departmental awards show at the country club this friday. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t tell her the truth, which is that while i like the people i work with (some of them very much) and can occasionally be talked into the occasional happy hour or holiday party, i very much do not want to spend my friday night (and especially not to force my introverted wife to spend her friday night) at a boring departmental awards show at the country club (and definitely do not want to spend $40 to buy tickets to do it)—i&#39;m thankful i didn&#39;t say that, because even if it was true it would have been a rude thing to say. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that instead of that, i said, &quot;<em>i&#39;m not allowed at the country club anymore&quot;</em> and gave her a mysterious look. i&#39;m thankful that i intended this as a joke but that, maybe because of our interaction the previous day, she didn&#39;t laugh and seemed to think i was being dead serious and looked at me in a new way and started to inquire excitedly about how i had gotten banned from the country club. i&#39;m thankful that instead of saying anything else, i made the motion of closing my mouth, locking my lips shut, and throwing away the key. i&#39;m thankful to imagine that someone could think someone as boring as me could do something as interesting as get banned from a country club.</p>
