        <p>i&#39;m thankful for my friend n, who i&#39;ve been thankful for a lot lately. i&#39;m thankful he&#39;s an architect (architectural artist, he would counter) and he&#39;s worked on a lot of new builds in London. i&#39;m thankful he&#39;s incredibly smart and excellent at what he does. i&#39;m thankful he&#39;s such an amazing friend. i&#39;m thankful a lot of times i don&#39;t think i actually deserve him as a friend. i&#39;m thankful he is kind- one of the kindest people i know. i&#39;m thankful that sometimes gets him in trouble but it&#39;s good trouble. i&#39;m thankful, because he&#39;s so intuitive and perceptive, he&#39;s able to look out for me in ways others have never been able to. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful two weeks ago, when i didn&#39;t get my visa in time to go to a conference, he and his brother j had me over for the weekend. i&#39;m thankful they made me a curry (according to my specs). i&#39;m thankful we had naan bread, rice, curry and loads of beer. i&#39;m thankful for the fruit i brought along to make a salad for desert. i&#39;m thankful i bought the fruit on the way to his instead of from the store just by his. i&#39;m thankful that of course, the raspberries got squashed and left a red trail while i got off and on the tube. i&#39;m thankful the salad was delicious anyway.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that evening was amazing. i&#39;m thankful i introduced him to kimmy schmidt and drag race. i&#39;m thankful we watched tv till about 3am, fell asleep in the lounge and woke up in the lounge. i&#39;m thankful now he won&#39;t stop chatting to me about the shows. i&#39;m thankful that on sunday j had to go somewhere so he left and n and i just chilled and chatted for hours. i&#39;m thankful we can talk about everything from supposedly flimsy things like kimmy scmidt to really deep things like what goes on in therapy. i&#39;m thankful for the spaghetti arrabiata i made to say thank you. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to remember the first time i ever thought i might like him. i&#39;m thankful it was a night when we sat on the steps of st. augustine queensgate and chatted for hours in 2 degree weather. i&#39;m thankful a lot of our heart to hearts happen on steps. i&#39;m thankful because of some ethical considerations i couldn&#39;t make a move at the time. i&#39;m thankful i was actually perfectly fine with being friends with him and then we just started to become really, really close friends. i&#39;m thankful for the night where we sat on the dirty steps behind south ken station and talked to midnight because he was having a bad day and he needed to talk to someone about it. i&#39;m thankful i could be there for him.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful those feelings still stayed as feelings are wont to do. i&#39;m thankful the other day after dinner, we sat watching telly in silence and it felt really intimate, like a moment i would want to freeze time in. i&#39;m thankful at that point to have felt the need to tell him how i really feel. i&#39;m thankful i was very ready to risk it all and tell him. i&#39;m thankful that instead i chatted with my girl squad about it and we all came to the same conclusion that i should do it because i hadn&#39;t been sleeping.  i&#39;m thankful i asked him to hangout the other day and we snuck up to the top of the southbank centre and had a drink on the terrace. i&#39;m thankful we watched the sunset together and again it felt really intimate. i&#39;m thankful i did risk it all and told him. i&#39;m thankful i had enough courage to do it.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful i prefaced with the fact that i didn&#39;t want it to change our friendship and he didn&#39;t have to reciprocate the feeling. i&#39;m thankful for the conversation we had after i told him. i&#39;m thankful because it made him sad he couldn&#39;t reciprocate the feeling. i&#39;m thankful we tried to resolve what that means for our relationship at the moment. i&#39;m thankful for the maturity that shone through the conversation. i&#39;m thankful for how he said &#39;are you okay?&#39; and i said i just needed a hug and he hugged me really tight. i&#39;m thankful that even though i was really sad the day after and just spent most of the day crying in the bathroom at work, i am now fine. i&#39;m thankful that even though i decided to risk it all, nothing has changed and we are still really good friends and still text everyday. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the privilege of being friends with this empathetic, smart, beautiful and hilarious man.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the gift of friendship.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i love nick with everything with me. i&#39;m thankful this will only strengthen our friendship.</p>
<p>moe (crying in a bathroom stall)</p>
<p>p.s. yes, this is a love letter, they still exist.</p>
