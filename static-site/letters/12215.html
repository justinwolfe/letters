        <p>i&#39;m thankful for the excellent run that i had at lunch today. i&#39;m thankful that the tall, thin, incredibly fast jamaican guy who always smokes everybody was there and i&#39;m thankful that i kept him from passing me for several laps, the two of us running in sync, side by side. i&#39;m thankful that a little while after he eventually did zoom past me, he slowed to a jog and i passed him at a slightly faster jog and gave him a thumbs up and told him how he was killing it and he smiled and said that i was keeping up with him. i&#39;m thankful how i ran into him later outside the locker room and we smiled and told each other to have a good day.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, in general, for how much more comfortable i feel with making small talk and interacting with people now than i was when i was younger. i&#39;m thankful that, in fact, i often enjoy these conversations and interactions. i&#39;m thankful for the small conversation i had about changes in the weather with the guy in a huge down coat and wooly hat as we stepped outside into the unexpected warmth of the afternoon. i&#39;m thankful for the conversation i had with the department chair when i complimented her on her skirt&#39;s fringe (even though i don&#39;t really like fringe) and she bragged about the brown leather knee high boots she had gotten for $19 from the macy&#39;s website on black friday. i&#39;m thankful for the small conversation i started with one of our advisors, who was sitting alone and excluded from faculty conversations while we waited for a meeting to start. i&#39;m thankful for the hilarious story she told me about a friend who was vomited on not once, but twice, by the person sitting next to her on a transatlantic flight.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that that stupid cliche phrase &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; really is kind of true for some things. i&#39;m thankful that forcing myself to smile because i work in customer service has made me more naturally and comfortably smile all the time. i&#39;m thankful to use my smile and i&#39;m thankful to think of it almost as a weapon of kindness—i’m thankful for the moments when i see someone who looks unhappy or stressed out in the hallway and i aim a smile at them and their face changes and i feel like a small good thing has happened.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, while i&#39;m running, to watch people shoot free throws on the basketball courts in the center of the track. i&#39;m thankful sometimes, as their balls arc through the air, to wish for them to swish effortlessly into the net. i&#39;m thankful for the ambient music of the balls bouncing through the natural reverb of the gym as i sit on the sidelines and meditate. i&#39;m thankful that even though i&#39;m always slightly afraid of being hit by a stray ball, the only time it happened, the ball neatly rolled into my lap and i chest-passed it to the player without even leaving lotus. i&#39;m thankful for my sometimes fantasy of having a basketball hoop and shooting free throws by myself as a meditative activity when i&#39;m older. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m finally letting go of the baggage of being bullied in 9th grade gym class in tennessee by this asshole who called me &quot;virginia slims.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the moment when i was so fed up with failing to be able to dribble or pass or shoot or, worst of all, make layups, that i broke down crying in the coach&#39;s office and begged him to let me run stairs or do pushups or anything else instead of play basketball for one more day. i&#39;m thankful that he listened to me and let me run stairs, even though he didn&#39;t have to. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t have to take gym class after 9th grade and i&#39;m thankful for the way in college that i rediscovered (or, really, discovered for the first time) how wonderful exercise can be. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m healthy enough and i have enough free time to be able to exercise regularly.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the bathroom mirror at the gym, which always makes my biceps look bigger than they are for some reason (maybe the distance from it, or the angle?). i&#39;m thankful that even if i recently put on a little holiday weight, i feel comfortable with my body. i&#39;m thankful to imagine that next time i&#39;m in miami, i could go to the clothingoptional beach that my parents love (though not with my parents, i don&#39;t think) and i wouldn&#39;t really feel self-conscious at all.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the moment yesterday, when i was trying to help one of the visiting lecturers open up a file cabinet in her office—the drawers wouldn&#39;t open, but there was no key hole, just a small metal knob where a keyhole might be. i&#39;m thankful that we both tried turning the small metal knob but it had no effect and we couldn&#39;t figure out why. i&#39;m thankful that when i asked people in the office if they&#39;d ever experienced anything else like this, they all said they hadn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful that when i asked my manager, she said she&#39;d come check it out. i&#39;m thankful that when she turned the small metal knob, she had the same experience that the visiting lecturer and i had. i&#39;m thankful, then, for the moment when she reached up and, grabbing the handle of the drawer, pressed the small button on the side of the handle, which the visiting lecturer and i had not seen or imagined or considered, and effortlessly pulled the top drawer open and then every other drawer after it. i&#39;m thankful for the laughter we all shared at that magically banal reveal.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to watch rows of students in basketball class make layups, one after another.</p>
