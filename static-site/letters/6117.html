        <p>i&#39;m thankful that i had an awkward experience yesterday when i was meeting a coworker for dinner at the cafe in the fancy grocery store and he wasn&#39;t there when i got there but there was this couple who d and i am acquainted with. i&#39;m thankful that the woman in the couple was clearly not making eye contact with me despite seeing me and that rather than do the same, i did an awkward half wave and then turned and exited the cafe, embarrassed. i&#39;m thankful that my coworker got there a few minutes later and i&#39;m thankful we had a nice dinner together out on the patio of the cafe and talked about interesting things. i&#39;m thankful after i relayed the story of how i&#39;d misunderstood a simple thing in python that was different from javascript that he suggested trying to do a basic django project as a way to get more comfortable with it. i&#39;m thankful that on my bike ride home, i came up with an elaborate fantasy about a prank d and i could play on the woman in the couple  i saw where d dmed her on instagram and told her she was afraid i was cheating on d and that i had said i saw the woman from the couple at dinner and that i had told d i was meeting this female coworker but actually she suspected i was meeting a guy i was dating and on and on like this because i love concocting ridiculous things like this. i&#39;m thankful to have made d laugh hard by sharing this story and the fact that i had thought about it so much when i got home.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d and i spent a long time happily talking to each other yesterday evening; i&#39;m thankful for that, since we were both so exhausted and irritable while dogsitting that we didn&#39;t talk to each other much. i&#39;m thankful for our time spitballing ideas for new tinyletters and podcasts. i&#39;m thankful she gave me a demo of a new feature that she oversaw development for at her job, which was very impressive (both the demo and the feature) and that she was impressed when i showed her some scripting i&#39;ve been working on to make our logging software easier to read. i&#39;m thankful to have had a good first day back at work yesterday. i&#39;m thankful that my weekly meeting with my lead went well and halfway through converted into a long javascript tutorial when i extemporaneously explained and demonstrated the differences between arrays, objects, methods, and functions and the different contexts in which they can be employed. i&#39;m thankful that they seemed to have been helped by my explanations and i&#39;m thankful that i was impressed with myself and my ability to speak fairly authoritatively on these kinds of technical topics.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d and i facetimed my parents last night. i&#39;m thankful they were entertained by our stories of dogsitting and the dead car battery. i&#39;m thankful that we reminisced about a water park we went to in north carolina when i was growing up and how one of the first times i learned to be truly afraid was in the wave pool at that water park, both because of the general chaos of a wave pool but also because i overheard my dad telling my mom a story about how he had seen a kid get carried into the shallows on a wave and how his back scraped along the rough concrete floor of the wave pool and when he stood up is back was torn up. i&#39;m thankful for my dad&#39;s suddenly remembering this moment as well. i&#39;m thankful i have other memories from that water park, such as how my dad and my brother did the bungee drop thing that was outside the park and how i remember watching them and feeling absolutely terrified that they would choose to do such a thing and by how small they were once they had been lifted up to the apex for the drop. i&#39;m thankful that i think i might like to try something like that now as an adult—i&#39;m thankful that though i still have lots of fears, they&#39;re not the same as the fears i had when i was a kid.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that there is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5yPKV1Jt6DOYazUvZl4qEI">a new big thief song</a> and that it is very pretty. i&#39;m thankful that i have been getting more and more into mac demarco after listening to his new album a lot. i&#39;m thankful for this early song i&#39;d never heard before, &quot;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2RLm6OrnjLuoyQEowCJ6QE">still together</a>,&quot; which is so intimate and the chorus melody of which reminds me of the melody from &quot;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2F4FNcz68howQWD4zaGJSi">the lion sleeps tonight</a>&quot; and i feel like is as close to the melody as you can get without it being copyright infringement. i&#39;m thankful to have listened to a lot of lil yachty yesterday and to have played some of my favorite songs to d. i&#39;m thankful that though i don&#39;t think he&#39;s a very good rapper i still like the gestalt of his voice and the way it interacts with the beats he chooses (which is the same way i feel about a$ap rocky, though he&#39;s definitely a better pure rapper than yachty). i&#39;m thankful that we&#39;re going to a housewarming party for one of my bandmates tonight, even though i don&#39;t really want to go, both because i&#39;m tired and i&#39;m kind of annoyed at the bandmate for various reasons. i&#39;m thankful to have been a total buzzkill in our band chat thread when the possibility of us doing a basically acoustic set came up and i poo pooed it by saying &quot;<em>i think as a band we benefit greatly from amplification,</em>&quot; which is something i feel strongly and that our previous partially amplified set was much inferior to our practices generally. i&#39;m thankful that if we aren&#39;t feeling the party we don&#39;t have to stay long. i&#39;m thankful for french exits, irish goodbyes, dutch leaves, and any other names for getting out of places quickly when i don&#39;t want to be there anymore. i&#39;m thankful to be an escape artist.</p>
