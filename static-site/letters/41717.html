        <p>i&#39;m thankful that it didn&#39;t really rain yesterday, that the hours just kept passing without it really raining, despite the weather forecast saying it was supposed to rain all day long. i&#39;m thankful when weather forecasters are wrong. i&#39;m thankful that in the afternoon i went out to go running and it wasn&#39;t raining but that somehow i didn&#39;t have the energy or the motivation and so walked a bit. i&#39;m thankful that this is rare for me, that i normally have the energy and the motivation, since it&#39;s a good way to empathize with other people who, because of their neurochemical makeup, might not normally have those things. i&#39;m thankful to have done an hour of yoga, which was nice and i&#39;m sure good for me, even if it didn&#39;t leave me on the endorphin high i would have gotten from running. i&#39;m thankful that i will go running this morning.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have done chores around the house that i needed to do. i&#39;m thankful to have bagged my sweaters and scarves and hats and coats and other winter clothes and put them away in the closet. i&#39;m thankful to have done two loads of laundry and to have put them away immediately. i&#39;m thankful to have put the clothes i wear on a daily basis (i.e., since i am a remote worker, t-shirts and sweatpants) in a place where they&#39;re easier to access. i&#39;m thankful to have filled up my medication and supplement pill organizers for the first time in several months, which is one of those tasks i should always do because it makes taking things so much easier and yet i am often lazy about actually doing, a laziness that results in a net total of way more effort than if i had just taken the time to fill the organizer once a week.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have not done any work this weekend. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that i have probably been doing too much work outside of work the past few weeks. i&#39;m thankful that i have felt motivated to do so and have enjoyed doing so, because i really like my job and there is so much to learn and so many opportunities to try new things, but i&#39;m thankful to recognize that it&#39;s also important to rest and recharge. i&#39;m thankful that though there are still some work things i want to try in the evenings this week and that it will be fun to try them, to also remind myself not to push too hard, since i don&#39;t want to burn out.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the college student who i overheard, semi-ironically but also semi-genuinely, say that she felt accomplished for having watched all of the <em>the fast and the furious</em> movies in one weekend. i&#39;m thankful to have overheard another talking about how in iraq, in lieu of toothpaste, her brother had brushed his teeth with spray cheese. i&#39;m thankful that another praised d&#39;s pretty summer dress and for my extended rambly compliment to d about how pink was the right hair color for summer, not on the nose like orange would be but still tropical—i&#39;m thankful to have realized, as i discussed the semiotics of different starburst flavors, to have realized how silly i sounded. i&#39;m thankful for our extended discussion of the implications of affixing &quot;boho&quot; as a prefix to different adjectives (i.e. boho-chic, boho-glam).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have sat in bed for several hours yesterday and finished reading <em>swing time</em>, which was an incredible novel, maybe my favorite of zadie smith&#39;s thus far. i&#39;m thankful that it is wide in scope while at the same time still feeling incredibly intimate. i&#39;m thankful for the way she starts chapters, dancing in and out of different timelines. i&#39;m thankful that the novel is often quite sad but never feels like a &quot;sad novel,&quot; which is a genre of which i&#39;m not a fan. i&#39;m thankful for the complexity with which she constructs and depicts her characters. i&#39;m thankful after finishing to have last night started reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0087GJ5WI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">roadside picnic</a></em>, which is quite fun so far.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful we watched part 2 and part of part 3 of <em>o.j.: made in america</em>. i&#39;m thankful for the <em><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS732US733&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=in+our+time+itunes">in our time</a></em> episode on rosa luxemburg. i&#39;m thankful whenever jacqueline rose, who is one of my favorite panelists, was on the show. i&#39;m thankful for the heated disagreement she got into with another panelist about whether luxemburg incited violence. i&#39;m thankful for the description of luxemburg&#39;s response to critiques of revolutionary violence, which had to do with all of the invisible violence that capitalism does unto the working class if capitalism persists without revolution. i&#39;m thankful that <em>in our time</em> always has a bonus clip where the panelists can talk for a few more minutes and i&#39;m thankful it always ends with a p.a. opening the door to the studio and asking if people want coffee or tea, which is such a lovely way to end the show.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have watched chrissy teigen&#39;s easter party on multiple snapchat stories. i&#39;m thankful to have just thought about the word &quot;stories&quot; and how in the past that&#39;s what people would call the daily soap opera they watched and how now it&#39;s what we call these little daily fragments we&#39;re fed of other people&#39;s lives. i&#39;m thankful for chrissy teigen and for her marriage to john legend, whose music i have never been the hugest fan of but who seems to be a really nice person who doesn&#39;t take himself too seriously. i&#39;m thankful to hope that it was he and kanye wearing the giant bunny costumes at the easter party. i&#39;m thankful to be hopeful that kanye is okay.</p>
