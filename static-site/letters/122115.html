        <p>i&#39;m thankful that there was a problem with cell signals traveling through the air when i went running through the thick gray morning yesterday and so neither my podcasts nor spotify were working and i had to listen to the only music i had on my phone, which was <em>1989</em>. i&#39;m thankful, despite quietly appreciating the undeniable &quot;you belong with me&quot; when it came out, that i didn&#39;t really like taylor swift for a long time and in fact actively disliked her for a while. i&#39;m thankful that when <em>1989</em> first came out, i didn&#39;t really see the appeal and gently mocked d for buying a CD from target rather than just torrenting it. i&#39;m thankful for the occasionally heated debates we had sitting on our apartment floor when i felt the need to set up lana del rey and/or beyonce (who we both loved) in a binary with tay-tay (who only she loved) as a way of enumerating their superiority to her, even though that was stupid and unnecessary and she was right. i&#39;m thankful that despite my grumbling, d just kept playing the album because she loved it so much, in the apartment and in the car and in hotel rooms and on her laptop, and i kept listening to it, less and less grudgingly and then more and more enthusiastically. i&#39;m thankful that over time, i was able to get past my initial resistance to the production, to this modern pop tendency for massed synths and harmonies and for everything to need to feel &quot;epic,&quot; and against my even stronger resistance to taylor&#39;s persona, the constructed good girl perfection of which seemed antithetical to the kind of musical personas i generally prefer (which are usually rooted in &quot;coolness&quot; and &quot;danger&quot; and some kernel of rockist authenticity, even if they are playing with/stretching that concept, as, for ex., lana del rey does).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that even if i roll my eyes occasionally at taylor now, i do so with affection. i&#39;m thankful i now find reading her social media and watching her cat videos and reading about her in profiles makes me happy, i&#39;m thankful to check in with her, and i&#39;m even more thankful for how much i&#39;ve come to appreciate the album. i&#39;m thankful how i still like hearing it in the car or in my headphones. i&#39;m thankful that the song that i initially found the most <em>hunger games</em> ridiculous, &quot;i know places,&quot; is actually my favorite song to run to now. i&#39;m thankful for its ferocity and for the way that the ryan tedder superchoruses slam in, giving me bursts of speed. i&#39;m thankful for the way the neurochemical intensity of running can sync up with music to make me cry sometimes while running even if i&#39;m not (consciously) sad. i&#39;m thankful for the thrumming catharsis of that.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that after d fell asleep trying to watch the second episode of <em>the expanse</em> with me last night after dinner, we left outer space to watch the <em>1989</em> concert film. i&#39;m thankful for my/our disappointment in the aesthetic of the special, for the way that the overcaffeinated editing and the weird figure skating costume mediocrity &quot;let&#39;s put on a show&quot; theater geek sense of it made me appreciate both taylor&#39;s videos (especially the &quot;style&quot; video, which i think is totally exquisite digital psych abercrombie porn) and beyonce&#39;s completely flawless video album even more (so i guess i still haven&#39;t abandoned that binary and i&#39;m thankful that i can cling to its wreckage). i&#39;m thankful that some of the concert rearrangements of her songs were interesting (&quot;trouble&quot; with a devilish drumless opening and an acid guitar solo at the end) and some were ill-advised, even if i can see the logic behind them (&quot;love story&quot; recast as room temperature stadium synth pad pop—never have i missed a fiddle more in my life, even if the exuberance of the key change in the final chorus was still able to push up through the reverb). i&#39;m thankful, despite the lameness of some of the staging and despite how taylor&#39;s &quot;intimate&quot; stadium chats with the audience represented the aspects of her persona that i like least, that the songs are still great and i still enjoyed hearing them sung and i&#39;m thankful that as i lost interest and looked at things on my phone, that d still sang along and i could listen to her voice layering with taylor’s and the stadium&#39;s. i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s singing voice, and i&#39;m thankful that she turned off the concert film early because she wanted to be able to better focus on a challenge in <em>zelda: a link between two worlds</em>, which i gave her as an early christmas present.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for zan romanoff&#39;s <a href="http://zanopticon.tumblr.com/post/101231107866/i-love-taylor-swift-so-much-you-guys-a">writing about taylor swift</a>, which d sent me when she was trying to convince me of how great she is. i&#39;m thankful for the other great things i read this weekend. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/i-dont-believe-in-god-but-i-believe-in-lithium.html?_r=0">this essay</a> by jaime lowe about lithium. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://lithub.com/knausgaard-writes-like-a-woman/">this essay</a> by siri hustvedt about literary misogyny and knaussgard. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinchack/for-sarge#.xjQbzrPDR">this essay</a> by erin chack about love. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m still enjoying <em>the thousand autumns of jacob de zoet</em>. i&#39;m thankful for the rest of that <em>new york</em> magazine was great, even if i&#39;d read a lot of it online already. i&#39;m thankful that after i confessed to her that, intending to just have a few pieces of the tub she gave me last week, i had ended up almost eating the whole thing, d surprised me with another giant tub of caramel corn which she had held in reserve. i&#39;m thankful that i will have lots of time to exercise during vacation. i&#39;m thankful for the old pair of laundry day underwear that had a large hole in the crotch, which i hulkishly ripped off my body to entertain d. i&#39;m thankful that though d and i both passed through clouds of irritability yesterday, we came together to make this <a href="http://www.cookmarked.com/recipe/Simple-Lasagna-with-Hearty-TomatoMeat-Sauce-Cooks-Illustrated--viCoCnP9xImNJMSIjd780PIyZ5YTkJfWDnuHpClxiJUe">delicious lasagna</a>. i&#39;m thankful to look forward to dinner tonight, when we can have more of it. i&#39;m thankful for leftovers.</p>
