        <p>i&#39;m thankful that last night in bed d was surprised by the sudden smell of oranges, which i at first lied and told her was because i had been eating a lot of oranges but then revealed was because i had put orange essential oil into the diffuser by our bed. i&#39;m thankful for the nice fresh smell of citrus. i&#39;m thankful that it reminded d of some disneyland/disneyworld ride she wasn&#39;t sure she had ridden but remembered as having a scene where you fly over a grove of oranges and they pump the smell in. i&#39;m thankful to have remembered riding the king kong ride at universal studios as a child and how my dad and i were impressed by the banana smell they&#39;d engineered for us to smell when king kong roared at us. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/828807654080380929">my dad and i still have similar interests</a>. i&#39;m thankful that my parents sent us a box of very juicy florida oranges, even though we are already pretty well stocked for oranges. i&#39;m thankful to have bit the top off of one of the oranges and kissed d and while kissing started to push the top of the orange into her mouth with my tongue as a rude surprise. i&#39;m thankful for how long and intensely the bitterness of the orange peel lingered in my mouth and for what an interesting taste it is. i&#39;m thankful for john mcphee&#39;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-John-McPhee-ebook/dp/B005E8AN0A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1486557618&sr=1-1&keywords=john+mcphee+oranges">oranges</a></em>, which i never finished i don&#39;t think but which i enjoyed while reading it. i&#39;m thankful that <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/828808752572809216">i am no longer in an mfa program</a>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have had my exit interview with our ceo and i&#39;m thankful that i think the conversation was productive and will hopefully help my team be happier once i&#39;m gone. i&#39;m thankful he seemed to be hearing me when i described the intensity of the problems facing my team and the causes and exacerbating factors for that intensity, which i think he had some awareness of but not as much as i think is necessary. i&#39;m thankful that i think i convinced him to have 1-1 meetings with the rest of my team. i&#39;m thankful he asked me about what i thought about d&#39;s changing role at the company, even though it was kind of inappropriate, because i was able to describe how impressed i&#39;ve been by her recent work and how happy it seems to make her to be making a bigger difference to the product. i&#39;m thankful that this week, i have to do live chat for 5 hours a day instead of the normal 3 hours, which is a long time and draining but i&#39;m thankful that i know i&#39;ll get through it and then i&#39;ll be done. i&#39;m thankful the extended shift means i get to work chat with one of my favorite coworkers and i&#39;m thankful that when i sent her a gif after she snatched a chat before i could get to it, she said &quot;you make work fun,&quot; which is what i want to hear. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/829000619063013376">national treasure chelsea peretti</a>, my favorite comedian. i&#39;m thankful for her comfort with discomfort. i&#39;m thankful that we had stopped watching <em>terrace house</em> for a while but came to it yesterday in the absence of a light half hour show to watch during dinner and were pleasantly surprised by a sudden shakeup and intensely meta twist that changed everything. i&#39;m thankful for the new character and for the small drama of his not taking off his shoes the first time he entered the house. i&#39;m thankful for the long conversation the characters had about having trouble ordering soba while drunk. i&#39;m thankful for the strangeness of the show, which unlike most reality shows is airing as it&#39;s being shot, yet the characters aren&#39;t isolated from the outside world as they are in, say, <em>big brother</em>, such that people the characters interact with in the world know their stories from the show and can interact with them about it. i&#39;m thankful for a very sad scene where a character cried beautiful tears after being rejected. i&#39;m thankful for d and i&#39;s conversation about the intimacy of being a hairstylist.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTJ2XkX7YRQ">lost in my bedroom</a>&quot; by sky ferreira. i&#39;m thankful for <em>multi-love</em> by unknown mortal orchestra, which i didn&#39;t really like when i tried listening to it when it first came out but which i&#39;m getting into now. i&#39;m thankful for <em>the solo sessions, volume 1</em>, by bill evans, which is my favorite meditation music. i&#39;m thankful for the new bass multi-effect pedal i bought, which has some really cool sounds. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/164976/Weakness-and-ignorance-are-not-barriers-to-survival-but-arrogance-is">this metafilter post about chinese science fiction</a>. i&#39;m thankful for two octavia butler books that i haven&#39;t read that are on sale for a quarter each (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parable-Talents-Octavia-E-Butler-ebook/dp/B008HALPHC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1486558208&sr=8-1">1</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parable-Sower-Octavia-E-Butler-ebook/dp/B008HALO4Q/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1486558232&sr=8-1">2</a>). i&#39;m thankful that we got wendy&#39;s takeout for dinner last night. i&#39;m thankful for fries with too much salt on them and am thankful to dunk them in a mound of ketchup. i&#39;m thankful for the chemical perfection of a chocolate frosty.</p>
