        <p>i&#39;m thankful that my mom was excited about the kindle i bought her. i&#39;m thankful that there was a sale on them the other day and that i knew she wanted one for their upcoming travels and so i bought it. i&#39;m thankful to have enough money right now that i can buy things like this for people in my life when i want to, without having to worry about whether i can afford it. i&#39;m thankful to do this, which makes other people happy and makes me happy. i&#39;m thankful that though money is bad, we can still sometimes use it to make ourselves and people we love happy. i&#39;m thankful that my mom has the money to quit her job for a while and travel with my dad, which i think (and hope) will make both of them happy.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have had a pretty good day at work yesterday. i&#39;m thankful to have talked to two coworkers about books we&#39;d read recently and am thankful that one of them is going to start a work book club channel in slack. i&#39;m thankful for the very kind and helpful engineer who took more than an hour out of his day to help me set up a local development environment for a project and teach me about git, react, redux, and the structure of the code for a tool that i&#39;m going to start being able to contribute to, which is really exciting. i&#39;m thankful to have had a nice meeting with my manager and that they shared some exciting personal news with me in a fun way. i&#39;m thankful that a customer who was really rude to me and gave me a bad rating doesn&#39;t matter in the grand scheme of things, even though it made me feel angry and still now makes me feel a bit angry. i&#39;m thankful to try to let things go. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/hildrethabed/status/915384588830150656">notes as processing tools</a>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <em>steamworld dig 2</em>, which i have been playing the last few days and which is totally delightful. i&#39;m thankful that in the game, you, as a cute cartoon creature named dorothy, dig down deeper and deeper into mines and caves below the world. i&#39;m thankful that the game has surprisingly deep and inventive platforming mechanics and that it feels very good to run and jump and swing on a rope and use a jet pack and all the other fun activities you can do. i&#39;m thankful for the structure of the world, for how as you gain new abilities, you find new things in old places that you couldn&#39;t reach when you were first there, which is very satisfying. i&#39;m thankful that the game allows me to do what i have discovered from <em>terraria</em> and <em>starbound</em> is one of my very favorite things to do in games, which is moving through dark caverns and other spaces and lighting torches/lamps in them. i&#39;m thankful for this thread about the development of <em><a href="https://twitter.com/gypsyOtoko/status/915037635663425536">breath of the wild</a></em>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://tinyletter.com/womencookforme/letters/shucking-oysters-with-eli-goldstone">this letter about the joys of oysters</a>. i&#39;m thankful <a href="https://twitter.com/RiRiHumor/status/910905544214499330">to watch rihanna feel and express pleasure</a> at something tasting good. i&#39;m thankful that i made <a href="http://www.thewednesdaychef.com/the_wednesday_chef/2014/02/fuchsia-dunlops-sichuanese-chopped-celery-with-beef.html">this favorite recipe</a> for dinner this week, even though i have not enjoyed it nearly as much as i usually do and have found it difficult to finish my portions, which is something that happened to me with our meals last week, and which in addition to other things (i have not been craving dessert, which is WEIRD for me) makes me think that my depression is flaring up. i&#39;m thankful for the strawberry banana smoothie i bought from the bougie grocery store because they were on sale, even though it wasn&#39;t really very good either. i&#39;m thankful to have bought doritos since my strongest food craving lately has been for doritos, even though, thinking about it now, even those aren&#39;t giving me the normal kind of pleasure anymore. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that while i was on the call with the engineer yesterday, i silenced an incoming call which i think is from the psychiatrist&#39;s office about setting up an appointment, so i&#39;m thankful to take a minute this morning and return that and hopefully open a door to something new. i&#39;m thankful that we are up to the third season of <em>bojack horseman</em> right now. i&#39;m thankful that <a href="https://twitter.com/poetastrologers/status/915056220276445186">other ways of living are possible</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/CuteEmergency/status/913623948356599809">this puppy</a>. i&#39;m thankful to live in a world where puppies exist.</p>
