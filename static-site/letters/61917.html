        <p>i&#39;m thankful that i don&#39;t have to work today, even though the reason i don&#39;t have to work today is that i had to work saturday. i&#39;m thankful that i won&#39;t have to work saturday again for a few months, since working six days straight is very draining. i&#39;m thankful for the new level of respect i have for my coworker c, who has a shifted schedule and so works on the weekend every weekend. i&#39;m thankful for the conversations we had about cracking boiled crabs, jiu jitsu, and billing oddities. i&#39;m thankful that though i normally think of myself as a solitary person, working by myself for most of the day was so lonely and made me really appreciate the camaraderie i have with my coworkers throughout the average work day. i&#39;m thankful that we share funny screenshots throughout the day, which is like self care that also helps other people. i&#39;m thankful that i don&#39;t have to work today but i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;ll be happy to see them tomorrow when i return. i&#39;m thankful that i have a four day work week this week and then i&#39;m off all next week to visit d&#39;s family in riverside.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that this week&#39;s band practice was really fun. i&#39;m thankful that though i miss the presence of our lead singer, their absence this summer has made it possible for us to do a lot of improvisational jamming, which is my favorite thing to do and a bit harder to do with a singer. i&#39;m thankful that the parents of our guitar player were visiting from utah and came by our practice for a while. i&#39;m thankful that i went out of my way to tell them how respected she is at work, which made her cry happy tears. i&#39;m thankful how happy and proud her parents were to watch her playing and singing with us. i&#39;m thankful that after they left, we played musical chairs with our instruments. i&#39;m thankful to have enjoyed playing both keyboard and lead guitar. i&#39;m thankful for how different guitar feels to me after playing bass for so long. i&#39;m thankful that our drummer played bass and i&#39;m thankful for how she kept shaking out her hands after a few seconds and saying how tired they felt, which made me feel good because i&#39;m always watching her drumming and it&#39;s so intensely physical that i can&#39;t even imagine how she can continue to do it as the rest of us pick and flick away with her hands. i&#39;m thankful that we are practicing on thursday this week because she has a weightlifting competition in louisville next weekend. i&#39;m thankful that playing with the band makes me want to play music at home, which is something i haven&#39;t done much of for a long time. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/songsabout/symph">my latest evening solo jam</a>, which our keyboardist compared accurately (in spirit) to castlevania music. i&#39;m thankful that i could roughly harmonize distorted guitars basically forever.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that saturday we went out to our favorite restaurant for dinner. i&#39;m thankful for the smoked trout dip with crudite and root vegetable chips; i&#39;m thankful for the salmon tacos, which pointed at a strange overlap between smoked salmon and chorizo; i&#39;m thankful for the fried frogs legs, which were both impossibly crispy and incredibly juicy. i&#39;m thankful that though we were going to get ceviche it took too long for them to make it so we didn&#39;t get it, which was probably a good thing (i&#39;m thankful for the verb &quot;acidulate&quot;). i&#39;m thankful for the fancy ice cream sandwich we had for dessert; i&#39;m thankful that though my allegiance will always be to the basic cheap ice cream sandwich with the wafer the melts against your tongue, this ice cream sandwich, which had a hard, dense toothsome wafer around cheesecake semifreddo, was really fucking good and one of the best desserts i&#39;ve ever eaten. i&#39;m thankful for the quattros leches cake we got, which was also great, though paled a bit in comparison. i&#39;m thankful to have captured <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/876206338099081216">d&#39;s dessert choosing algorithm</a> for posterity.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday we went on a long walk, which turned out to be a much longer walk than we had anticipated (i&#39;m thankful for how d noted that there could be a history of our relationship that just focuses on unintentionally long walks we have taken, usually because of a mistake or miscalculation i have made). i&#39;m thankful that near the kroger, we passed by the first apartment i lived in here, which was in a building with yellow siding across the street from a halfway house. i&#39;m thankful that the apartment was a pretty terrible apartment but that i loved it and that i spent so much time with d there. i&#39;m thankful as we continued our walk, with the goal of me getting to see the house we&#39;re going to live in next year, which i hadn&#39;t seen in person yet because i waived my participation in that research and decision making process, we realized that the house was in a very different spot than either of us had imagined it was, requiring us to walk a long way on the shoulder of a busy road to get there. i&#39;m thankful that though this made me slightly stressed at first, i&#39;m sure the house will be a great place to live and even if there are problems, they will probably be problems like an unintentionally long walk is a problem, which is, while sometimes tiring or frustrating, not really a problem and still overall a positive experience. i&#39;m thankful that on our way back, we took a wooded trail instead of the busy road and i&#39;m thankful for the shade of the canopy above us. i&#39;m thankful for the sensation of returning home after a long walk.</p>
