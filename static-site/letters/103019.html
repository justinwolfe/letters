      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful for the slack bot we have at work which, ever half hour or so, finds the most recent &quot;great&quot; rating that someone on our team has received from a customer (they can give ratings of &quot;great&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, and &quot;not good&quot;) and celebrates it with a fun gif and an announcement for coworkers to reacji with support and praise and i&#39;m thankful that a great rating i received at the end of my weekly support shift yesterday was celebrated by the bot, especially since i had just a few minutes before received a &quot;not good&quot; rating from another customer that hurt my feelings. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the &quot;not good&quot; rating will not harm me materially and i will get over it emotionally, and i&#39;m thankful that because of years working customer support, it is very difficult for me to be able to forget that there is a human being on the other side of the screen who has feelings and who is not &quot;lazy&quot; because they weren&#39;t able to solve my problem immediately or at all, which is something that i have noticed that people of my age and social class and political affiliation who would, on principle, never tip less than 20% in a restaurant or give an uber driver a bad rating unless they felt unsafe, seem to be able to forget sometimes. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to understand that doing online customer support isn&#39;t as precarious as those other two jobs and i&#39;m thankful to understand that the harm in those other two cases is more acute and material than in the customer support case, which is a distinction that maybe those people draw in their heads and which i can&#39;t fault, and i&#39;m thankful to also know that some people and some companies provide genuinely bad customer service and for customers for whom a particular product or service is essential in one way or another (and in a way that&#39;s more serious than one bad hamburger or a slow ride to a party), bad customer service can be a serious problem, especially if their lives are already hard in one or more of the myriad ways that modern life is hard for people, which they often are, but i&#39;m also thankful that my experience doing this work has helped me feel solidarity with the person on the other side of the screen and i&#39;m thankful, always, for people who feel that way too and are grateful for the help that we try to provide.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that we facetimed with my parents yesterday evening and had a nice chat with them and got a tour of their new apartment in colorado. i&#39;m thankful that i was in a good mood and so were my parents and d and i&#39;m thankful we all love each other. i&#39;m thankful to have learned that my dad was voted employee of the month at the dispensary where he works as a budtender, and i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s close enough to the apartment that he can walk to work everyday and that he, who has never been a big fan of walking, does that, since it&#39;s good for his health. i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s so close that when he works afternoon/evening shifts, he comes home for dinner and eats with my mom and then goes back to work. i&#39;m thankful to remember my last year at my third high school and how, because i was so horrifically socially isolated and anxious and my mom wasn&#39;t working at the time, most days she would pick me up at lunch and we would go home and eat pasta or ramen noodles and watch <em>the young and the restless</em>, a service without which it would have been much harder to get through that very hard year. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful i got through that very hard year and there have been many good years since then. i&#39;m thankful i checked in with a friend who reached out to me recently about her anxiety getting worse and i&#39;m thankful that she&#39;s hanging in there. i&#39;m thankful that i felt vindicated after a bug that i reported last week and that was kind of dismissed turned out to be a major issue that caused a lot of problems, which, i&#39;m not thankful for the problems it caused but i&#39;m thankful that it was a sign i should trust my instincts more (and also that i can do a better job of identifying and communicating the scope of an issue than i did). i&#39;m thankful i wrote some good code yesterday and that i will have the opportunity to write some more good code today. i&#39;m thankful for a DM conversation i had with a coworker about murakami tropes. i&#39;m thankful to have taken out the trash and recycling and compost. i&#39;m thankful that the fajitas i made (without a recipe) for us to eat for dinner this week are so good and were so easy and something i should make from scratch rather than ordering as delivery. i&#39;m thankful that though there&#39;s not enough left for proper fajitas tonight, i can make some rice and make us burrito bowls. i&#39;m thankful tomorrow is halloween and my friends are having a party.</p>
