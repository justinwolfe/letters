        <p>i&#39;m thankful that after it rained all day yesterday, a wave of cool air came in, which made this morning feel like the first flush of fall. i&#39;m thankful that it was supposed to rain all day today too but now it isn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful to have gone for a run and to have not ended it with my clothes completely soaked through with sweat. i&#39;m thankful that the warm weather will be back in a few days, but i&#39;m thankful for this taste of days to come. i&#39;m thankful to have had shin ramen for lunch. i&#39;m thankful for the built-in portion control of ramen in a cup, since when i make it from a packet in a bowl it&#39;s always too much broth and i feel bloated afterward. i&#39;m thankful for the espresso-flavored mini snickers i had for dessert (check your local halloween aisle, they also have chili ones and &quot;sweet and salty&quot;, which basically already describes the flavor profile of a snickers and so seems somewhat redundant).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful i did not have a nervous breakdown and become afraid that i was dying or was in imminent danger of dying and have to seek medical attention as i have around three (3) separate labor day weekends in the past decade, which feels like a kind of progress. i&#39;m thankful that i have lost a little weight since i moved my runs to the morning and have been able to go longer every day and also started doing those arbitrary daily pushups, not because i think losing weight is virtuous or is going to make any real difference to my health, but because usually when i look at myself in the mirror i&#39;m comparing myself to some generalized and hazy platonic ideal of myself (there aren&#39;t a lot of old pictures of me because i used to hate having my picture taken for this very reason, and the fact that i don&#39;t hate it as much feels like another kind of progress) and i so rarely measure up to it and &quot;look like myself&quot; (the way i imagine myself to be from inside) and that makes me sad, to not like the way i look, and lately when i&#39;ve looked in the mirror, i&#39;ve felt i look like &quot;myself&quot; slightly more often than normal.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though i feel very anxious about going to work tomorrow, i know that is something i always feel to a certain extent on a sunday and that i always feel extra extra hard on the sunday after a vacation. i&#39;m thankful that though knowing this (and knowing that lots of other people have those same kinds of feelings) doesn&#39;t make me feel that much less anxious, it is still good to remember it. i&#39;m thankful that i am very respected and appreciated at work, even though a side effect of that can be me putting too much pressure on myself. i&#39;m thankful that at this job i am always growing and learning, even though that can be stressful. i&#39;m thankful to feel good about the future in general, even if i feel some anxiety about tomorrow and the day after that and the rest of the week and so on. i&#39;m thankful that though i had planned to do some work this afternoon to try to get ahead of things for next week, i&#39;m going to try not to do that (i&#39;m thankful to have stopped my brain from looping and made some notes about the things i was planning to do to help get them out of my brain, since one thing that i think can lead to me ruminating is the idea that if i don&#39;t keep thinking about these ideas i will forget them)(i&#39;m thankful to remember a habit i had when i got my first smart phone, when i was first starting grad school, which was to constantly record voice memos of ideas i had, which felt important even though i never listened back to them).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://ask.metafilter.com/326230/Everything-in-my-life-should-be-as-simple-as-possible-but-no-simpler#4699163">this ask metafilter thread of things that people have given up doing</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/markleidner/status/1037605939778445312">this tweet</a>, which starts with the tone of the banal advice in one of those threads and then becomes, through the power of weirdness, a kind of poem. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/that1mum/status/1038067196507955200">this tweet about masturbating with an electric toothbrush</a> (something i also tried as a youth). i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/VitaVirginiaBot">this bot</a> collecting fragments of the letters of virginia woolf and vita sackville-west, which is my favorite twitter bot since <a href="https://twitter.com/sontagdaily">the susan sontag diary bot</a>. i&#39;m thankful to metafilter also for <a href="https://www.metafilter.com/176399/Dirty-Girls">this post</a> introducing me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MxEHQk644">this video</a> of a group of punk-feminist eighth graders known as &#39;dirty girls&#39; in santa monica in 1996. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that we ordered pizza last night from the good pizza place. i&#39;m thankful that we always get the same two pizzas from them: one which has red sauce and sausage and pepperoni and whole olives and onions and one that has more mozzarella and prosciutto and roasted grapes and arugula and honey. i&#39;m thankful for how pleasurable it is to alternate between slices of the &quot;sweet&quot; and &quot;savory&quot; pizza. i&#39;m thankful that because it is expensive, i usually restrain myself so we can have leftovers the next day, but i didn&#39;t do that yesterday and ate all the pizza i wanted. i&#39;m thankful we watched the christina tosi episode of <em>chef&#39;s table</em>, which was enjoyable, even though that show normally feels pretty flat and airless to me, because i like her as a person and have actually eaten some of the food in the show and so could remember/imagine what it tasted like more than i can with most of the food on that kind of show.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that last night before bed, i started reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BLLFKS5/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">crudo</a></em>. i&#39;m thankful that though i bounced off of <em>the lonely city</em> when i tried reading it a while ago, p tweeting about how good <em>crudo</em> was made me decide to give it a chance. i&#39;m thankful i did, since i really like it so far—it feels like a melange of geoff dyer and gertrude stein and frank o&#39;hara and lots of other ways of thinking and feeling i love (&quot;<em>short skirts but in sentences-form</em>&quot;). i&#39;m thankful for the tumbling run-ons, the pinball of the voice, grace notes of acidity squeezed and zested over the crowded trains of thought. i&#39;m thankful for the description of the 2016 election as feeling &quot;<em>like the Red Wedding episode only actual and huge,</em>&quot; for the weight &quot;<em>only actual and huge</em>&quot; is carrying there. i&#39;m thankful that it feels like if a novel was twitter (not the individual unit of the tweet, but the cumulative effect of being in the stream) in the best possible way.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful also for <a href="https://twitter.com/chillmage/status/1036988687823851520">this description of twitter</a>. i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s possible <a href="https://twitter.com/ohsalad_days/status/1038606480965083136">to sing without crying</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/markleidner/status/1037579093212950528">this taxidermy</a>. i&#39;m thankful to think that <a href="https://twitter.com/post_rhymes/status/1038569433390874624">inner space is finite</a>.</p>
