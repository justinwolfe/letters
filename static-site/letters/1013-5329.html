        <p>i&#39;m thankful that i have let myself not write thank you notes lately, but i&#39;m thankful to be writing them now. i&#39;m thankful that on my work trip, a new friend told me that something she appreciated about me was my tendency to appreciate other people appreciating things (meta). i&#39;m thankful to have felt proud and to have known that part of the reason i so readily slip into that in other aspects of my life is this daily practice. i&#39;m thankful for that and don&#39;t want to lose it, but i&#39;m thankful also to be easy with myself.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for a one-two-punch pair of tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/ohevie">evie</a>, the first of which, &quot;<em><a href="https://twitter.com/ohevie/status/1050490469275365378">Can you die from a bad attitude</a></em>&quot;, poses an existentially interesting question/statement (i&#39;m thankful for questions without question marks) and <a href="https://twitter.com/ohevie/status/1050896376471666688">the second of which</a>, &quot;<em>I continue to survive my attitude,</em>&quot; is funny but also honestly very moving? (i&#39;m thankful for non questions with question marks) and is a mantra that i think i will actually use. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/VitaVirginiaBot/status/1047693454283821061">vita</a> and i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/heatherchristle/status/1048595636780720128">miricles</a>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that my work trip was good. i&#39;m thankful for the new friend, who i really like, and i&#39;m thankful also to have gotten quality time with lots of my old friends. i&#39;m thankful that the weather in arizona was perfect, allowing for both daytime work sessions by the pool and comfortable night walks. i&#39;m thankful for the weird &quot;cool&quot; boutique hotel we were in which had many odd features, including, in lieu of providing irons and ironing boards to each room like a normal hotel, an &quot;ironing room&quot; on each floor in which there was music playing 24 hours a day and a floor to ceiling photograph of a shirtless man ironing. i&#39;m thankful that though the hotel food sucked, there were good restaurants near it. i&#39;m thankful for my favorite of the &quot;cool&quot; hotel features, which was that the front desk was also the bar and they gave you a drink while checking you in.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the workshop i gave (build your own API in 30 minutes) was enthusiastically well-received by our team and that the kind engineer DMed me to tell me how well i had done. i&#39;m thankful for the new leader for our team, who i only had a few interactions with, but who seems nice and smart and human. i&#39;m thankful that the CEO of the company came to our retreat, which is a demonstration of his investment in our team. i&#39;m thankful to have had a week away from working directly on my work project and to have gotten to have good conversations with people about it.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when i got back to bloomington, it was suddenly cold, 36 degrees the first morning back that i took miso out. i&#39;m thankful, since she was born in the summer, to wonder about how she is experiencing the cold; i&#39;m thankful, when the leaves first started turning, to have been outside with her when a sudden gust sent a flurry of them falling from the trees and down onto the grass around her, which shocked her. i&#39;m thankful that she is getting bigger every day, her body more solid and her tail fluffier. i&#39;m thankful for the carpeted stairs d got so that she can climb on and off the couch, which leads to her sitting with us more.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d is playing the new <em>assassin&#39;s creed</em> right now, except she&#39;s not playing <em>right</em> now but instead is looking at her phone while her character&#39;s horse takes her character across the map on autopilot. i&#39;m thankful for <em>maniac</em>, which ticked all my TV pleasure boxes. i&#39;m thankful that <em>the good place</em> is back (and for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/04/magazine/good-place-michael-schur-philosophy.html">this NYT magazine story about it</a>) and that d and i had that great contemporary experience where you think you only have one episode of something beloved to stream but actually, bc of your disconnection from time and the traditional TV release schedule, have two. i&#39;m thankful to be excited about <em>the romanoffs</em>, even though i know it won&#39;t be as good as <em>mad men</em>. i&#39;m thankful for the backlog of my favorite podcasts that built up over my work trip.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that it is saturday and after a very busy and social week, i am home with just deborah and miso and we can just chill. i&#39;m thankful for chilling, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/noname/status/1048988255046139905">my favorite activity</a>. i&#39;m thankful for this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2CoDMiE45b6csTqt2iAO7T">soft guitar</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/cornytesoro/status/1051107191372025856">this video of a baby pig getting a bath</a>. i&#39;m thankful for you.</p>
