      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that on my walk home from work yesterday, i stopped at the gas station on the southern edge of downtown to buy something for us to have for dessert. i&#39;m thankful that the door to the gas station was propped open, probably because it was warm outside and the attendant wanted to let in warm air. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when i entered the gas station, there were no customers and the attendant was not present. i&#39;m thankful that, having triggered the too-loud chime that rings when someone enters the store, i didn&#39;t have to negotiate the awkward tension that sometimes exists between properly acknowledging the gas station attendant on one side of the store and making a bee-line for the aisle with the candy on the opposite side of the store. i&#39;m thankful, as my eyes scanned the candy selection, that i almost immediately settled on an extra-large size hershey&#39;s cookies and cream bar (i&#39;m thankful that i find sugary cheap white chocolate to be satisfying and thankful that d shares this tendency with me). i&#39;m thankful that i was able to make my dessert decision quickly rather than being stuck pondering my options. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when i went to the counter to check out, the attendant was still gone. i&#39;m thankful that, as time went on and the attendant still did not appear, as the sound of traffic leaked in through the door from the rush hour outside, i briefly thought about just taking the chocolate bar and walking out. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t do that(i&#39;m thankful that i have never shoplifted, though i&#39;m also thankful to hear the stories of people i know who stole as innocent children, such as when d shoplifted a bracelet and my friend jk took an abacus from a preschool classmate&#39;s cubby)(i&#39;m thankful for the amazing tumblr k-hole d introduced me to which is the <a href="http://www.techinsider.io/there-are-crazy-shoplifting-blogs-on-tumblr-2015-8">lifting</a> scene). i&#39;m thankful for the surprising sense of peace in the brightly-lit gas station as i stood there waiting, and yet i&#39;m also thankful for the way that peace was ruptured (or maybe that&#39;s too violent, maybe just complicated) when two chinese men entered the gas station. i&#39;m thankful for the way they smiled at me, and then thankful for the conversation they had that i listened to without really understanding but which seemed to be about the various lottery tickets on offer in the plexiglass case on the counter. i&#39;m thankful for the way they pointed at different scratch-off tickets and made jokes to each other and laughed.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful when the attendant bustled out from behind the bathroom door and stepped behind the counter. i&#39;m thankful for the flustered way she said &quot;i&#39;m so sorry to have kept you waiting...i don&#39;t have a sign that i can put up to tell people to wait.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that i smiled at her and told her, with as much kindness as i could embed into my vocal tone, that it was &quot;totally okay.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for &quot;totally,&quot; which is my favorite intensifier, and i think the one that is best to use to comfort people who feel as if they have or are about to inconvenience you (i&#39;m thankful to use &quot;totally&quot; a lot at work to assuage people&#39;s guilt at assigning me menial tasks). i&#39;m thankful that as the attendant apologized to me again, i said, trying to elevate the issue from the personal to the global and express solidarity, &quot;it&#39;s totally okay! it&#39;s crazy how the world acts like people don&#39;t need breaks. everybody has to go to the bathroom!&quot; i&#39;m thankful, after the last sentence came out of my mouth, how i felt briefly awkward for associating the time she was away as being spent in the bathroom, which felt like a breach of propriety, of the social contract, but i&#39;m thankful that i said it, because afterward she beamed at me and said, &quot;yes! and it&#39;s so hard when you&#39;re standing, like i am, and you really have to pee&quot; and i&#39;m thankful for the small performance of the i-have-to-pee dance she delivered to illustrate her plight as she finished ringing up my transaction. i&#39;m thankful when people ask me if i need a receipt and i can say no.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that after leaving the restaurant i spent way too much money on takeout sushi for dinner. i&#39;m thankful that the new restaurant i bought it from has the best sushi i have had so far in a small midwestern town, which is not really saying anything and yet, at the same time, is.  i&#39;m thankful for thick slabs of buttery yellowtail sashimi. i&#39;m thankful, over and after dinner, to have watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Jw1DO_kFM"><em>the big fat quiz of everything</em>,</a> which featured hilarious jokes from chelsea peretti, mel from <em>bakeoff</em>, richard ayoade, and several other very british comedians (noel fielding, jonathan ross, and some guy i hadn&#39;t heard of before but who was very funny). i&#39;m thankful for the honor roll student in me who insisted on yelling out the correct answers to questions (american gothic is by grant wood! alfred nobel invented dynamite! buster keaton&#39;s feet were nailed down because a house was going to fall on him), even though the quiz show is a platform for jokes and i was not actually a contestant and d, the only other person present, did not really care. i&#39;m thankful for the memory of family reunions with my cousins when i was a child, when, for some reason, the same episode of <em>jeopardy</em> aired on two different local channels at 7:00 and 7:30 each night, so that my cousins and i would sometimes, when feeling naughty, watch the early airing in a back bedroom and then come out to the living room for the later one and astound all with our knowledge. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that, playing a quick round of darts before bed, i hit my first bullseye.</p>
