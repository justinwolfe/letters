        <p>ended the work week really happy with the work i&#39;d done and feel like i&#39;m going into the next work week with much less dread and not even feeling like i&#39;ll need my optional sunday xan.</p>
<p>watching my tasks move from the left side of the sprint board to the right side of the sprint board. the unit of time i conceive of for a given body of work shifting from one week to two</p>
<p>texting with my manager memes about the speakership election outside of work. that she and i talk so well and happily and have so much in common, such that in addition to work stuff, this week&#39;s 1:1 involved discussing the varieties and reported health benefits of honey, her dog&#39;s recovery from ACL surgery, glass onion and her responding to my critiques of it, metaphors about boiling frogs and lobsters, hating paul ryan, the podcast about ben shapiro&#39;s book, harry and meghan, andor and her position that it&#39;s less a TV show than 4 movies </p>
<p>all the AOC content (grinning in the background meme, bad lip reading) and this morning her instagram story unboxing of an issue of The Paris Review she bought to &quot;treat herself&quot;, which reminded me of this blog past (this is a typo but i&#39;m keeping it bc i love a freudian typo) i wrote during the 2012 election when i was nonfiction editor for our school literary magazine (<a href="https://indianareview.org/2012/09/partial-transcript-of-secret-presidential-debate-on-contemporary-literature/">https://indianareview.org/2012/09/partial-transcript-of-secret-presidential-debate-on-contemporary-literature/</a>).</p>
<p>we finished watching andor which was so fucking good and now i get to consume the secondary sources about andor that i&#39;ve been hoarding (primarily several issues of max read&#39;s newsletter (<a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/what-made-andor-so-good">https://maxread.substack.com/p/what-made-andor-so-good</a>) and the a more civilized age podcast (<a href="https://amorecivilizedage.net">https://amorecivilizedage.net</a>) run on it)</p>
<p>diego luna who is so sexy although there is this plot point that assumes that him kind of shaving his facial hair somehow makes him look like not diego luna who is so sexy</p>
<p>my electric guitars sound so much better since i put heavier strings on them. deborah painted the keys of my current homemade foot controller with her paint pens so they stand out better (forever thankful for this blog past: </p>
<p><a href="https://cdm.link/2007/08/get-loopy-with-the-diy-10-ableton-footcontroller-no-soldering-required/">https://cdm.link/2007/08/get-loopy-with-the-diy-10-ableton-footcontroller-no-soldering-required/</a>). cliphyx pro, a plugin for ableton live that makes possible composition and performance things that otherwise aren&#39;t (</p>
<p><a href="https://isotonikstudios.com/product/clyphx-pro/">https://isotonikstudios.com/product/clyphx-pro/</a>). all the time i spend optimizing our studio setup and my ableton project template, which is often frustrating and tedious (even as a person whose job is all about dealing with fiddly complex things that are often frustrating and tedious)</p>
<p>those trader joes chocolate covered espresso beans, which i took bc i was afraid of falling into weed sleep during the last run of <em>andor</em> but meant i was still wireda t midnight and slept so terribly and my body feels like shit! acceptance of the fact that my body is just not a body that gets to have much if any caffeine</p>
<p>it&#39;s not yet sumo mandarin season but it is peak pomelo/pummelo season and if you would like some variety in your fruit life i recommend one—they are a pain to peel but the fruit while related to the grapefruit is also distinct from it (i found a time in jan 2020 i was more articulate and called it &quot;the pomelo, a rare late-in-life new fruit for me, which is real pain to peel but is sweet and yet tart, the beatles to the grapefruit&#39;s stones&quot;</p>
<p>eating through the box of christmas treats that my parents sent (thankful for every holiday package since my parents started working in what they call &quot;the cannabis industry&quot;, which in addition to weed (okay &quot;cannabis&quot; sorry mom!) stuff also included trader joe&#39;s jingle jangle mix (a tin of chocolate covered pretzels and popcorn, peanut butter cups, knockoff M&amp;Ms, and etc.)</p>
<p>the air fryer, which i was deeply resistant to for the longest time as i was to other kitchen gadgets but then deborah saw one produced by drew barrymore&#39;s company (?) was on sale and asked if we could get it and i relented and i fucking love this thing! i was trying to pitch it to my manager (famously not a cook) as &quot;like the microwave but for the oven&quot; and she came back that the microwave was supposed to be the microwave for the oven and fair but it just does so many things so well and so easily.</p>
<p>the frozen siu mai, potstickers, and shrimp tempura we cooked for dinner in the air fryer last night and the frozen burritos i cooked in it for my lunches (which get this crispy texture that makes them almost like egg rolls on the outside!).</p>
<p>we&#39;re watching f the corgi for a week and it&#39;s always nice to have her because she&#39;s so loving and cuddly and also i like the dynamic it introduces in miso which in terms of me paying attention to f is not quite jealousy (though it is with deborah) but she seems to take more &quot;interest&quot; in me and not &quot;take me for granted&quot; (this is all projection, she is a dog). that k, who for the longest time was like me and ec a non-driver, became an Official Driver recently and drove f over all by herself, which is so impressive!</p>
<p>deborah and i had like a hard two day fight last week but we got through it (thankful for her capricorn therapist) and have had a totally blissed out weekend together.</p>
