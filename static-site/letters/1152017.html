        <p>i&#39;m thankful that though i slept poorly last night, i sleep well most nights, so it could be worse. i&#39;m thankful for the weird dream i kept having where there was a woman who was squatting in the attic of our house and i couldn&#39;t get to her because there wasn&#39;t a ladder and also none of the lights in the house would turn on. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that this is is a common trope of scary dreams for me, trying to turn a knob or flick a switch to turn on a light and see what is there and nothing happening, me stranded in a darkness which is full of horrible possibility. i&#39;m thankful that i kept doing that thing where you have a bad dream and wake up from it and then try to go back to sleep and go right back into it and this happens multiple times. i&#39;m thankful eventually i stopped this cycle by putting on my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AcousticSheep-SleepPhones-Classic-Headphones-Medium/dp/B0046H8ZHS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484491486&sr=8-1&keywords=sleepphones">sleepphones</a> and listening to an old episode of food on franklin at low volume.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the strange thing i have noticed when i have scary dreams now, which i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a side effect of medication or aging or both, which is that when i wake up in a sweat, it&#39;s usually not my whole body that&#39;s sweating (though sometimes that), but is my pubic hair and genitals that are hot and damp with sweat. i&#39;m thankful that sometimes i reach down after waking from a scary dream and touch myself as i guess a way of knowing how scared i really was? or maybe it&#39;s just a way of asserting i am in the here and now, the way children are told to pinch themselves to tell whether they&#39;re in a dream. i&#39;m thankful to know this is weird and tmi but i&#39;m thankful to somehow find my wet pubic hair comforting in the middle of a dark night. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the conversation we were having during a break at band practice the other day, which was about flying dreams. i&#39;m thankful to have surprised everyone by telling them that i am jealous of people who fly in dreams because i have never been able to. i&#39;m thankful for my consolation prize for flying dreams, which are my dreams of bouncing, in which i shoot off the ground into the sky as if out of a cannon and i think i might be about to fly but then my velocity slows and at a certain point i hit the apex of an invisible arc and start falling. i&#39;m thankful that this is often terrifying, as i plummet back down to the earth, about to be smashed against the ground, but i&#39;m thankful that in the dreams, just when that&#39;s about to happen, instead, my feet connect with the ground painlessly (with reassuring solidity, even), my knees bend, and i spring up into the air again, tracing a new arc. i&#39;m thankful that though i hope someday to fly in a dream this is still a pretty amazing sensation to experience in a dream. i&#39;m thankful for our singer, who was talking about how she flies often in dreams but there it feels difficult, like she&#39;s in a heavy fluid and it&#39;s difficult to get anywhere.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that work was good on friday. i&#39;m thankful that i got a promotion, which does not fix everything that is broken about work but could maybe help some and which at least has given me a bit of hope, which i needed. i&#39;m thankful that i noticed an important bug before anyone else and am thankful to have written a good bug ticket about it. i&#39;m thankful to have built an internal tool to make a team process easier. i&#39;m thankful for the new weekly friday afternoon thread in our main channel that somebody created where we can talk about books and tv shows and music we are enjoying. i&#39;m thankful that it was not so busy on friday afternoon so that i was actually able to participate in this thread. i&#39;m thankful for the way that learning about what people do in their free time can help to deepen and complicate the office caricatures that can form in our minds. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the new xx album, which i&#39;m thankful i saved to listen to with d on good speakers after dinner last night. i&#39;m thankful to think is a perfect third album in that it has all the magic that made me love them in the first album but puts an entirely new frame around it. i&#39;m thankful that it has inspired me to try harder with jamie xx&#39;s solo work, which i&#39;ve never really been able to get into so much, since his sonic fingerprints define so much of what makes their music great. i&#39;m thankful that as a band, i think they have an association with melancholy, but what i love are the moments when brightness peeks through the clouds, which are nicely spread across the new album. i&#39;m thankful for the quiet ambient album <em>migration</em> by bonobo, which includes a gorgeous guest spot from the singer from rhye. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/820309731193585664">the lily allen cover</a> of the clash&#39;s &quot;straight to hell,&quot; which d introduced to me and which is very beautiful despite being such a dark song. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for this clip of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jqJFnICK_g">the office</a></em>, which is one of my favorite clips of the office. i&#39;m thankful that our dinnertime rewatch is on the last season, which is the worst season, but i&#39;m thankful that even in bad seasons of television, there are often wonderful moments. i&#39;m thankful that last night, we watched the first episode of <em>the young pope</em>, which is so bizarre and which i kind of love so far. i&#39;m thankful for decadence and thankful for spectacle. i&#39;m thankful for the period in my life where i was addicted to cherry coke zero before i realized that 90% of the time caffeine makes me feel like i&#39;m dying, which is not worth the 10% of the time where it puts me into a perfect flow state of productivity. i&#39;m thankful for diane keaton.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to feel mild distress that i haven&#39;t been able to really get into a book deeply recently but i&#39;m thankful to know that i have felt this before and that it will eventually pass. i&#39;m thankful that d checked out the scratch anthology from the library (ha! i&#39;m thankful for all the people who stole <em>steal this book</em>) and that i was able to read the essays by the three writers in it that i know. i&#39;m thankful that last night i started a reread of erik larson&#39;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Beasts-Terror-American-Hitlers-ebook/dp/B004HFRJM6/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1484491767&sr=8-1">in the garden of beasts</a></em>, which is a nonfiction book about a university of chicago historian who FDR picks for lack of a better option to be the US ambassador in berlin in 1933. i&#39;m thankful for the book which is terrifying re: the normalization of fascism in our present tense, but at the same time readable (i&#39;m thankful that history is less frightening than journalism right now, since at least it already happened and the world didn&#39;t end and we lived after it). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to say <a href="https://twitter.com/natalieweiner/status/820084748542509057">fuck this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RealDLHughley/status/820165211801862144">fuck him forever</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/cassmarketos/status/820328713761890304">today&#39;s feeling</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/COMETHRUGIRL/status/803373267423727620">this amazing bit of flash (i hope) fiction</a>. i&#39;m thankful for jenny slate. i&#39;m thankful for chat with friends about <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/820053794201411584">mice and semen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RuthCurry/status/820280734619488260">supplement hauls</a> (i&#39;m thankful to wonder how long before mouse semen becomes a supplement, which it maybe is already but i&#39;m afraid to google). i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_LO8_YVwg1YnVxeU1hY09QR0k/view">these handwritten thank you notes</a> from <a href="https://t.co/g3mmmYvU6h">rohie&#39;s tinyletter</a>. i&#39;m thankful for the new chapstick i got at CVS yesterday, which is blistex&#39;s orange mango blast and which tastes exactly like the tropical flavor pack of tic tacs, which is a very good thing.</p>
