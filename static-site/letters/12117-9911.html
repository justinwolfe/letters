      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday, i left the house on my lunch break to pick up my sleeping pills from the pharmacy. i&#39;m thankful that before i left, i applied a temporary fix to my rear brake cable, which kept popping out of the brake lever receptacle but which with my bare hands i couldn&#39;t tighten enough to keep that from happening. i&#39;m thankful for duct tape, which i wouldn&#39;t depend on longterm or if i was going fast, but was strong enough to get me around town.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my pharmacist, who knows me and grabs my prescriptions from their cubby as soon as she sees me without asking my name and also remembers that i&#39;m married and asks if i&#39;m picking up for d. i&#39;m thankful to address her by name, which makes both of us happy. i&#39;m thankful to talk to her about the weather and am thankful that she was happy it had stopped raining and wasn&#39;t very cold outside. i&#39;m thankful that i told her about walking home from band practice in the rain the previous night and that she told me about how the driveway at her babysitter&#39;s house is prone to puddling and how when she picked up her kids after work, they were jumping in the puddle and splashing her. i&#39;m thankful that she was talking about how this was annoying but that her smile also showed how it made her happy. i&#39;m thankful for our conversation about how wet shoes and socks don&#39;t bother kids but are the most miserable thing when you&#39;re an adult.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that after the pharmacy, i biked over to the supermarket to pick up milk. i&#39;m thankful that a lot of the bike parking was unused because it was immersed in a huge puddle, so we were all pushing into the other parking. i&#39;m thankful while locking up my bike to have made a joke about it to a little old lady in a rain jacket who was unlocking her bike. i&#39;m thankful that she laughed and started to go, but then turned to me and said, in a slight accent that was hard to place, &quot;<em>i noticed your helmet</em>.&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that she told me about how she grew up in the netherlands, where everyone rode bikes but no one wore helmets. i&#39;m thankful she told me about how she doesn&#39;t like wearing helmets, though i&#39;m thankful she was wearing one. i&#39;m thankful that she asked me about my helmet, which is a dark grey skateboard helmet, and how i told her that it was a bit heavier than a standard bike helmet but was comfortable and hopefully provided good protection. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that she smiled and paused and said, &quot;_i noticed your helmet because it reminded me of when i was 4 in the netherlands, when they were occupied by the german_s&quot; and i&#39;m thankful to have gasped said &quot;<em>oh my god, do you mean my helmet makes me look like a nazi</em>???&quot; and i&#39;m thankful that she smiled and said that yes, it looked nearly identical besides the air holes in the top of the helmet. i&#39;m thankful to have expressed horror that my helmet looked like a nazi and am thankful that she touched my arm and told me that she knew i wasn&#39;t a nazi and didn&#39;t think anyone but other old people from the netherlands would see the helmet and think that, but just that she had noticed it and thought it was interesting. i&#39;m thankful that i told her i will get some brightly colored stickers to affix to the helmet. i&#39;m thankful we had a bit more small talk before wishing each other a good day and going our separate ways.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the way that when the macro forces of the world become overwhelming, there is still solace to take in small good things. i&#39;m thankful for a 76 year old woman who was asked what she would be doing at 12pm yesterday who said &quot;<em><a href="https://twitter.com/twelveoclocke/status/822437029703286784">i&#39;ll be at the gym so i can live to vote trump out.</a></em>&quot; i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/dailydoseofjess/status/822802063004405761">baby feminists fighting for kindness with their smiles</a>. i&#39;m thankful to know that young people want a different, better world than the one we have now and i&#39;m thankful to hope that with them we can work to make that world and live in it together. i&#39;m thankful that nothing in life lasts forever.</p>
