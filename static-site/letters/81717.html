        <p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday i had the cardiac stress test that the doctor scheduled for me after i went to the ER a few weeks ago for a panic attack that i, as i have many times before, mistook for a heart attack. i&#39;m thankful for the oddness of running on a treadmill with a bunch of wires connected to my chest while being attended to by two nurses, which made me feel like a professional athlete or a superhero in training. i&#39;m thankful that the nurses were polite even though they clearly thought there was nothing wrong with me, which there most likely isn&#39;t. i&#39;m thankful that when i asked one of the nurses if she was having a good day so far, she, probably pre-coffee, said &quot;<em>well, it just started, so i don&#39;t really know yet</em>!&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have been reminded of the nice older lady from air canada who i called at the beginning of the week to see if i could get on standby for an earlier flight home and who, after finding out there weren&#39;t any good options, paused, then said, &quot;<em>let me tell you what i think you should do. i think you should go have yourself a nice lunch, then visit a museum or walk around shopping, just have a very good day in toronto, then catch your scheduled flight home at 8:45</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for how much she wanted me to have a nice day. i&#39;m thankful for how nice it is when that&#39;s clearly a feeling and not just a recitation and to hope that my messages to customers sometimes function as incantations.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the cold medicines i bought yesterday seem to be helping and that if not 100%, i feel markedly better today. i&#39;m thankful for the weird zicam nasal swabs i bought, which come in little tubes and which you swirl around the inside of your nostrils in hypnotic ritual. i&#39;m thankful that even if this isn&#39;t helping my cold, it feels nice (i&#39;m thankful that it is reminiscent of dipping a qtip in hydrogen peroxide and then swirling it in your ears, even though that feeling is far superior (if more dangerous i am not your doctor)). i&#39;m thankful that though cough syrup tastes gross (i&#39;m thankful, perversely, for those substances that taste so bad that you can&#39;t help but pull a face and make an unpleasant sound after consuming them), it makes me cough less and makes coughing less painful. i&#39;m thankful for acetaminophen. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to be on the third day of my new antidepressant and to (knock on wood) have not experienced any side effects from it yet. i&#39;m thankful that though i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve felt any real difference yet because of the fog and fatigue of my cold. i&#39;m thankful that i haven&#39;t felt very anxious in the past few days, just tired. i&#39;m thankful that yesterday while making dinner for d, i danced unexpectedly vigorously in the kitchen alone to the perfect algorithmically generated one-two-three punch of &quot;no frauds,&quot; &quot;whip my hair,&quot; and the remix of &quot;real love,&quot; which felt like a good sign.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i finally had band practice last night after weeks of not having it. i&#39;m thankful that i was worried that it would be awkward because we hadn&#39;t played together in a while and i couldn&#39;t get stoned before, it was just as lovely as it always is. i&#39;m thankful that when the drummer came in, she immediately started talking to me about pb&amp;j oreos, which we agree are a top oreo flavor. i&#39;m thankful that we played around with a few new (to us) songs, including the amy winehouse version of &quot;valerie,&quot; which has a very fun bass line to play. i&#39;m thankful that we discussed our shared love of showering in the dark and imagined a cover of lorde&#39;s &quot;writer in the dark&quot; called &quot;shower in the dark.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the keyboardists description of his ultimate dark shower, which is a hot shower in the dark in the winter with a window open in the bathroom letting in cold air while drinking a glass of whiskey and smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my long bike ride home to our new house. i&#39;m thankful for the interesting visual phenomenon that occurred as i rode along the bike path, how the streetlights were placed at intervals that cast shadows such that as i passed each light, a ghost of me on my bike seemed to accelerate past me and disappear into the next shadow, only to reappear and pass me again at the next light. i&#39;m thankful to have ridden like this with my ghost for several miles. i&#39;m thankful for the strobe setting on my bike light, which makes me more visible to things and things more visible to me. i&#39;m thankful for both kinds of visibility.</p>
