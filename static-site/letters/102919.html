        <p>i&#39;m thankful that the endlessness of my gmail archive means that i have the email where someone we went to grad school with shared a recipe for this excellent apple cake, which we had at a friendsgiving at her house</p>
<ul>
<li>1 3/4 cups sugar, divided (I used white and brown, a mix b/c I was running out)</li>
<li>1 stick butter, softened (I used about 7 tablespoons--already had used some of the end)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>6 ounces block-style fat-free cream cheese, softened (about 3/4 cup)</li>
<li>2 large eggs </li>
<li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  (I used whole wheat and like it better)</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
<li>3 cups chopped peeled Rome apple (about 2 large) I used jonagold. all are good, really</li>
<li> Cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Put the oven at 350</p>
</li>
<li><p>Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar, butter, vanilla, and cream cheese  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to creamed mixture. I just add flour on top, and powder and salt on top of that. Mix the dry a tad while its on top and keep mixing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Combine 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon. Combine cinnamon mixture and apple in a bowl, and stir apple mixture into batter. Pour batter into an 8-inch springform pan (or a 9x9 square) coated with cooking spray</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bake 55 minutes. The recipe says an hour and 10 but I only do 55. It should be done then.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday afternoon d made this cake and i&#39;m thankful, as i worked on a feature i had spent all day on because it ended up being more complex to code than i had thought but was increasingly questioning the utility and worth of as i went, in an environment in which my engineering time is a limited resource and is needed to solve big problems (and yet at the same time feeling that i had, because of the time i&#39;d spent on it so far, to finish it, since otherwise all that time would be totally wasted, and maybe the feature <em>would</em> be useful), the warm smell of it wafted in from the kitchen, a balm</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, from my desk, to have DMed d about how good it smelled and i&#39;m thankful that my phone pinged a little while later with a message from d, telling me she had accidentally forgotten to put flour in the cake, fml.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have come to the kitchen to comfort her and i&#39;m thankful that the heavenly smell was stronger there and i&#39;m thankful that she told me that she also forgot the baking powder (i&#39;m thankful that i said that was a virtuous mistake, since without flour, there was no need for baking powder). i&#39;m thankful to have comforted her and laughed with her and told her that this combination of butter, sugar, cream cheese, apples, and cinnamon would be delicious even if it wasn&#39;t technically a cake and that i was excited to eat it regardless. i&#39;m thankful she decided to go get vanilla ice cream so we could use the &quot;cake&quot; as a topping, which was indeed delicious.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when d was putting herself down because she&#39;d forgotten the flour and baking soda, like saying how could she do anything if she couldn&#39;t remember simple things like this, and i&#39;m thankful to have told her, so she didn&#39;t feel alone, that i had put down my expensive bluetooth exercise headphones somewhere in the house several days before and could not find them no matter where i looked, even though i knew they were in the house. i&#39;m thankful that though i meant this as a gesture of empathy and solidarity, d started looking for the headphones, and within just a few minutes found them in the place i had left them, under the big billowing curtains of our front window beside a low chair where we sometimes sit together.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful she found them and that i have them now for my workout, since it was hard hearing my podcasts on my phone speaker over the treadmill. i&#39;m thankful that though in retrospect some of the things i&#39;ve spent my time on the past couple weeks aren&#39;t the most important things, that&#39;s helpful (if unpleasant) for me to realize, and i&#39;m thankful to know that, in the absence of someone else telling me what the most important things are for me to work on, i tried my best. i&#39;m thankful to know that despite my negative feelings, i <em>have</em> done some useful things too, and have learned valuable things, and have impressed myself with my ability to write cleaner code. i&#39;m thankful to have hope that sometime soon i will have more help and guidance with this prioritization and management work and i will be able to focus more on just writing code and not getting distracted by a meta-evaluation of its larger value (though also i think it is helpful to not always think of it as code qua code, since that and my ego have led me down a few rabbit holes lately).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s laugh, which is such a beautiful sound, and i&#39;m thankful that she is generous with it when i try to make her laugh, and appreciates my perennial efforts in that direction, which are a form of love. i&#39;m thankful for miso, who is such a funny little dog, even if she&#39;s sometimes a butthead and is gross. i&#39;m thankful that though every day of live is, in some ways, a struggle, in others, it is a celebration, and i&#39;m thankful not to forget that.</p>
