        <p>i&#39;m thankful it was my birthday saturday. i&#39;m thankful i really don&#39;t like the awkwardness of organising something for people to come eat a meal and &#39;celebrate you&#39;. i&#39;m thankful i thought i&#39;d make an effort this year because there is a nigerian tapas pop-up place i wanted to go to. i&#39;m thankful when i asked my friends, some of them were up for it. i&#39;m thankful to then have found out it was closed for the month. i&#39;m thankful i cancelled the plans. i&#39;m thankful i forgot to tell f i had cancelled. i&#39;m thankful for the stupid moment when i was about to leave work on friday evening to have a birthday mcdonald&#39;s and sleep when she called and asked where we were meeting. i&#39;m thankful i freaked out and just went off on a tangent of why did she not know it had been cancelled. i&#39;m thankful i realised my error and then got myself together to go for a drink with her and l. i&#39;m thankful for gin and elderflower presse, which is as amazing as it sounds. i&#39;m thankful for bourbon and coke. i&#39;m thankful for the moment when i realised i was getting drunk. i&#39;m thankful i haven&#39;t got drunk since new year&#39;s when i was breaking my year-long alcohol fast. i&#39;m thankful for the vegan chocolate doughnuts she bought me. i&#39;m thankful hanging out with her is always fun and i&#39;m happy i did. i&#39;m thankful i went home and had my mcdonald&#39;s.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful my actual birthday day was okay. i&#39;m thankful i don&#39;t like people on a normal day and like them even less on my birthday. i&#39;m thankful to not know how to tell people i&#39;m close to that it&#39;s my birthday. i&#39;m thankful i didn&#39;t have to remind a lot of people, though. i&#39;m thankful for the nice feeling that comes with your friends remembering your birthday without facebook prompting them. i&#39;m thankful while making breakfast, to have given my sisters a tour of my flat via snapchat. i&#39;m thankful i had corned beef sandwiches for breakfast. i&#39;m thankful when i came out of my room to do the dishes, my flatmate l had got me two bouquets of my favourite flowers. i&#39;m thankful my people know the way to my heart. i&#39;m thankful she also got me a coffee and walnut cake and a snazzy notebook that had a print similar to one of my shirts. i&#39;m thankful she asked me if i wanted to go on a walk and i said yes. i&#39;m thankful she&#39;s starting to understand how to cheer me up. i&#39;m thankful we went to ravenscourt park and there was a kid&#39;s party in the park. i&#39;m thankful for pink balloons and unicorn balloons and giant bubbles. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful when i got back there was a video on my phone of my cousin and my nephews singing &#39;happy birthday&#39; to me. i&#39;m thankful my nephew who&#39;s just starting to speak mumbled &#39;happy birthday&#39; to me. i&#39;m thankful when i called them later, his face lit up when he saw me. i&#39;m thankful this is probably because i&#39;m the fun aunty and whenever i go to theirs, i take them out to do something fun so their mum can have some peace. i&#39;m thankful my cousin then ordered me some pizza. i&#39;m thankful pizza is such a treat for me because every time i have to eat it, i have to book one specifically without cheese which makes it expensive. i&#39;m thankful for the point on my birthday when my family calls me. i&#39;m thankful i&#39;m okay until my mum prays for me in yoruba and then i just bawl my eyes out. i&#39;m thankful they called me in the evening so my crying didn&#39;t really dampen the day. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for n, my really good friend who i may like-like (cringe). i&#39;m thankful a couple of weeks ago i was talking about not being able to go to something because it was my birthday and he reminded me his birthday was the day after mine. i&#39;m thankful for how weird it is that one of my best friends&#39; birthday is the day after mine. i&#39;m thankful for all the weirdness in my life- like another one of my best friends has the same quite rare name as me. i&#39;m thankful n and i decided to have a &#39;friend&#39; breakfast date on sunday- his birthday. i&#39;m thankful he&#39;s one of the few people i&#39;d get up before 8 am on a sunday for. i&#39;m thankful he sacrificed breakfast with his family to have breakfast with me. i&#39;m thankful for the mushiness that comes with birthdays. i&#39;m thankful for the point in breakfast when he said &#39;you&#39;re my best friend in london&#39;. i&#39;m thankful there weren&#39;t any string instruments in the background but it felt like one of those moments. i&#39;m thankful because of some of my hangups, i couldn&#39;t exactly communicate that he was my best friend in london too. i&#39;m thankful i wrote him a card to say thank-you and all the other things i wanted to say and posted it to him. i&#39;m thankful i am now freaking out that it was a bit much and could be interpreted as me confessing my undying love for him. i&#39;m thankful i love him and will always do, whatever he is to me.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for those friendships you know will last a very, very long time. i&#39;m thankful i have those. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for doughnuts and drinks with f. i&#39;m thankful for flowers, cake and a walk with l. i&#39;m thankful for songs and smiles from my nephews. i&#39;m thankful for candles and quality time with n. i&#39;m thankful my heart is full and i know people in my life love me. </p>
