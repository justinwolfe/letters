Do you have a super brain?_\" which were nice to return to when it felt like everything was broken (i'm thankful to have to have reassured him that he can do it and to have also told him that weeks ago when leadership asked me for insight about the role, i said that if he builds something and it breaks and that causes problems that's a sign he's actually delivering value, which is something i then repeated to myself about my broken thing literally the next day). i'm thankful that friday afternoon, i wrote a draft of a post for the engineering blog they're trying to resurrect at work and enjoyed remembering how good i am at writing and liking the idea of building a professional brand for myself by doing something i am good at and enjoy (writing) rather than things i don't enjoy (social media marketing, job applications).\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/261.jpg) \n\ni'm thankful, having lately been in a state where artistically (outside of work) i feel like i'm just kind of walking on the anhedonic treadmill and not really accomplishing anything much of substance, for the times when i break through that and make something (i'm also thankful to know that this kind of cycle is normal and i've been from peak to trough to peak many times before). i'm thankful to have made an erasure of an article about poets reacting to the new taylor swift album, which [you can hear me read here](https://www.instagram.com/absence.of.field/reel/C56GQlyxeVO/) (i also made [a jet meme](https://www.instagram.com/absence.of.field/reel/C57o8hju0lf/) since you know i love those). i'm thankful for getting high and playing electric guitar, which even if it doesn't result in producing a deliverable i can do so very happily for basically any amount of time (i'm thankful for the calluses on my left finger tips and for heavy weight guitar picks and for multi-effects pedals and amps). \n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/260.jpg) \n\ni'm thankful for [the dry herb vape](https://www.pax.com/vapes/pax-3) my parents gave me, which i have been using a lot lately and which i like because it gives me the durational consumption experience i get from smoking a joint/blunt (vs. the immediacy of my old standby of the bong) while being less harsh on my throat than smoking too many joints/blunts (which i also did this weekend since it was a holiday in my religion and that was great too). i'm thankful to have also taken mushrooms over the weekend, even though they didn't hit as hard as i'd wanted (i'm thankful for the stability prozac gives me, even though it means i never trip as hard as i want anymore), and am thankful that [redacted] sent me a picture of the first mushrooms harvested from their home growing operation (and thankful to remember years ago when d did this for us in our grad school apartment, a period of unprecedented psychedelic plenty that eventually led to me having a bad trip and giving up mushrooms for years lol but i have no regrets other than not understanding that i should not take any kind of drugs on an empty stomach).\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/259.jpg) \n\ni'm thankful it was miso's birthday on saturday and we spent it happily with friends. i'm thankful that though it ended up not being as nice outside as we had hoped it would be, we had cleaned the inside of the house and had just enough seating for everyone. i'm thankful that though my current favorite pizza place cancelled our delivery order because they were sold out, my previous favorite pizza place came through. i'm thankful that deborah has been really into making cocktails with fresh juice and delicious syrups lately and thankful for the carrot cake we bought from new seasons, which was moist and had an appropriate frosting/cake ratio and surprised me by having raisins in it, which is not something i'd experienced in carrot cake before but really enjoyed. \n\n## Previously on this day:\n\n- [2016](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/thank-you-notes-422/) (_space rocket history podcast, john ashbery on cornell boxes, coffee peanut M&Ms_)\n- 2016 ([2](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/thank-you-notes-421/)) (_my struggle volume 5, MFA memories, delivering lunch to the academic advisors_)\n- [2017](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/42217/) (_\"lust for life\" (lana del rey song), chewing gum (show), american honey (movie)_)",
