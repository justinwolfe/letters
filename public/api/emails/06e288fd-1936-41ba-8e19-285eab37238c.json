Make sure to take this time for yourself—it’s important <3_\n\ni'm thankful for those breaks, without which i might not have developed the steady yoga and meditation practices that are so important to me. i'm thankful, in general, for the free time and space that i had during the course of my days here, without which i probably wouldn't be writing this to you right now. i'm thankful even though sometimes having so much free time was a curse, which is part of why i'm excited about the prospect of moving to something new, something that will require more from me, but thankful for how often it was a blessing.\n\ni'm thankful for the sad goodbyes with other faculty and staff members and students, which i know are only sad because i added something good to their daily lives and they added something good to mine.",
