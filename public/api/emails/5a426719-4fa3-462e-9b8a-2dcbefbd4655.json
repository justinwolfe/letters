  "body": "i'm thankful that yesterday morning, i was about half an hour into the workday, after having already gone to an appointment and worked out, when i noticed that my calendar said i was working on sunday, whereas i thought i would be working on saturday, since that is the weekend shift day i usually go for, because it means you get to take off the following monday and i had the belief that taking off monday is better than taking off the preceding friday (which is the day off you get if you work on sunday), because friday is already the emotionally easiest day of the week and so why would i want to take that off, but for some reason it hadn't worked out and i had friday off and i realized this half an hour into the day and so i put up a status message and suddenly it was the weekend.\n\ni'm thankful that i was going to slip into my default weekend morning mode of smoking half a joint and lying on a beanbag in the front room and reading _new york_ and _the new yorker_ but then i had the thought that we could take in a matinee and maybe get some dim sum and asked d if she wanted to do that (she loves those two things so i thought it would be a yes) and she did and so we got dressed and had dim sum at our favorite dim sum place (which now has new options to try!) and then went to the nearby dispensary that sells $1 joints (i'm thankful that i thought that it was limit 4 total but actually it was limit 4 per strain so we got 8) and i'm thankful that we then went to the movie theater and hotboxed the car in the parking lot and i'm thankful for the theater we went to, which has a coke freestyle machine that i can use to make an enormous cup of dasani lemon lime seltzer with ice rather than buying a sad token water bottle and i'm thankful that because it was a friday afternoon we had the best seats in the theater and that they recline with foot rests.\n\ni'm thankful for _knives out_ which was a confection of pure pleasure and made me laugh a number of times, starting with a joke where a character mentions having heard of someone from a tweet about a _new yorker_ article. i'm thankful that all the performances were delicious and the directing was fun and it was twist upon twist upon twist. i'm thankful for the country ham of daniel craig's performance. i'm thankful that last night we rewatched _the last jedi_, my personal favorite _star wars_ movie, for the nth time, and i'm thankful that though we both fell asleep, it was still enjoyable and comforting. i'm thankful we watched the third episode of _living with yourself_, a show which is a stressful proposition to consider and experience but which is also so well done (echoes of charlie kaufman, directed by the showrunners of _the comeback_) that it continues to pull me in.\n\ni'm thankful that we made indomie noodles for dinner and that i seeded a pomegranate to go with them, which was imo the perfect companion. i'm thankful for brownie brittle, a bag mix of which i impulse bought from an endcap and that d made the other night and reminds me of things i love about fudge without the uneven quality and markup of store-bought fudge. i'm thankful that d is going to a holiday market with ec today and i'm thankful that i don't have to go. i'm thankful that the company holiday party is tonight and i'm thankful, since this is my \"sunday\", that it falls in my usual \"sunday scaries\" time, so i'll be distracted from that, and then tomorrow will still be quiet, as sundays tend to be.",
