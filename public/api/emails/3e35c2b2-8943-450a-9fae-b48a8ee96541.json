I was angry about having to cut my lunch short to rush back to the office to deal with something stupid and urgent and this picture came to mind as a summation of my feelings at the moment. When the picture popped into my mind as I was rushing down the street, I laughed out loud. I probably looked like a crazy person to the people at Subway watching me stomp past them on the busy downtown street, but this picture is so funny to me I couldn't contain my smile. It is such a perfect distillation of that feeling when you are TRYING SO HARD to keep your shit together and oh-my-God WHY ME. I'm thankful this picture exists to instantly cheer me up.\n\n\\- sarah c (1/3/18). \n\n[what are you thankful for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
