  "body": "i'm thankful that after an imperfect day on tuesday, i had a really good day at work yesterday, probably the best one i've had so far. i'm thankful that i stood up all day using my improvised standing desk on top of our dryer. i'm thankful that i felt energized all day and like i had entered a flow state (i'm thankful for the mental image i have when i imagine the phrase \"flow state,\" which is of a surfer gliding along the crest of a wave. i'm thankful for the pleasure of concentration and for the luck of for the most part being presented with problems i'm capable of handling. i'm thankful to remember next time i have an imperfect day, as i did on tuesday, that it's totally possible that the next day will be a really good one.\n\ni'm thankful for my friendship with e from work and that we DM each other songs to listen to during our workday. i'm thankful that the most recent run of this started when she shared the song \"[give it up](https://open.spotify.com/track/3yDhZq8f17SmumVmEyCaRN)\" by kc and the sunshine band, which is a wonderfully exuberant (yet at the same time laid back and chill) slice of disco pie. i'm thankful that winter is over, which means not just a new actual climate but also a musical climate (i'm thankful for summer music, which is my favorite music). i'm thankful for [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/new-array/playlist/0KU2pz9LTsYdA2mPhGDn0S) i made from an algorithmically-generated set of jazzy trip-hop songs, which i think would be a good accompaniment to the writing or working or thinking you might do today.. i'm thankful for [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4SkTfsjWUy2rp40d2Ayfmv), which feels like a very romantic rauschenberg combine, so full of play with texture and noise.\n\ni'm thankful for e and i's shared affection for \"[liability](https://open.spotify.com/track/4JyLFq2mHC8JPFTXHwYPWD)\" by lorde and for our attempt to find similar songs, which resulted in an extended listening session of covers of \"[all the young dudes](https://open.spotify.com/track/0WNGPpmWqzPnk0psUhJ3SX),\" which included versions by [david bowie](https://open.spotify.com/track/0aBEwadSLwZtJe029jwlfl) and (truly) [ozzy osbourne](https://open.spotify.com/track/1VzHYblFdt9cTPGuoZX7Ss), both of which are lovely and have this extra poignance because they're being sung by old men rather than young dudes (i'm thankful that rick rubin didn't get johnny cash to do a stark acoustic cover of \"all the young dudes,\" though if he did i probably would have listened to that too). i'm thankful for [this sad forum thread i found](https://t.co/LXbLH8Dehs) when i was sad to find out that slade isn't on spotify.\n\ni'm thankful that d was on a call with her sister last night and her sister said the sentence \"_i'm almost out of a specific glitter i like so i'm buying more_.\" i'm thankful for our discussion of this shipping trick, which both d and r's sister use frequently but which r and d's sister and i had not ever thought of. i'm thankful that d's sister was drinking brisk iced tea, which brought back a lovely shared memory between the two of them of when they were kids and d was in \"japan club\" at school and when d's sister and her dad would come to pick d up e would get a styrofoam cup of brisk, which was a very happy memory for her. i'm thankful to remember how i liked brisk too, for the intensity of the artificiality of the lemon flavor. \n\ni'm thankful for the \"american bitch\" episode of _girls_, which was WILD and pretty much a perfect television episode imo, though perhaps my affection for matthew rhys contributed to that unduly (i'm thankful for [this post](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-cunning-american-bitch-episode-of-girls) by emily nussbaum). i'm thankful to hope that ray and shosh, who are the couple i ship and the only couple whose outcome i really care about, get together before the series end (plz don't spoil me). i'm thankful that _[the wanderers](https://www.amazon.com/Wanderers-Meg-Howrey-ebook/dp/B01HCGYYA6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1490615365&sr=1-1&keywords=the+wanderers)_ just gets better and deeper and more powerful and i really recommend it, even if you don't normally read science fiction, because it has the best explorations of characters' thought processes in anything i've read in a long time.\n\ni'm thankful for [this amazing hypnotic compilation of pharell](https://twitter.com/Genius/status/849768550378156032) doing the same musical trick over and over again.i'm thankful for [madonna](https://twitter.com/katienotopoulos/status/849778994899804162) and i'm thankful \"[teens are fucking wild](http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/teens-use-snapchat-scissor-tool-to-enlarge-dick-pics.html?mid=twitter_selectall)!\" i'm thankful to remember, years before i would ever have sex with anyone, to remember trying to trim my pubic hair with kitchen scissors to make my dick look bigger. i'm thankful for [the kind of porn i'm into](https://twitter.com/SauceyTacos/status/849369933410693125). i'm thankful for [this thread of stuff from carina's personal archives](https://twitter.com/presidents/status/849575252468170752). i'm thankful to know [this pain](https://twitter.com/KTHeaney/status/849760459817398273) and (oof) [this pain](https://twitter.com/ohevie/status/849719732215267328) too. i'm thankful that sungwon cho's videos always make me laugh hard but [this recent one really made me laugh hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w700Q_5-y0). i'm thankful for [possibly the ultimate burn](https://twitter.com/geekylonglegs/status/849809495165460484).",
