Magnified, the edge resembles a snowy mountain range about four thousandths of an inch thick; the snow is paper dust, ready to drift into a printer’s jammable gears_\") and for the way that the article's prose style models that same kind of close attention and enacts the desire to find the small detail that unlocks the problem and makes things move.\n\ni'm thankful to be struck by how little i interact with printers now (basically only at checkout counters), considering much of my life used to involve printers back when i worked at the university. i'm thankful to remember the odd printer that was by my desk which, unlike any other printer i'd seen, used these chunky blocks of wax that looked like big crayons but were still somehow coded (with physical holes and slats) to be copy protected. i'm thankful to remember the little plastic separator in the paper feed of the big copier that had to be situated just so between the two big stacks of 8/12 by 11 or else the copier would see the paper feed as empty. i'm thankful to remember how happy people would be when i could unclog their jams in time for their conference paper or meeting agenda or pop quiz to be printed before they had to leave the office. i'm thankful for the heat that would emanate off a big batch of something that had just been popped out of the printer.\n\n\"_Paper jams are a species within a larger genus. Traffic jams, too; so do tape decks, guns, and sewing machines. On humid days, voting machines jam, leading to recounts; over the aeons, tectonic plates jam, resulting in earthquakes.
