  "body": "i'm thankful for how much my parents care about seeing the weather forecast on the local TV news. i'm thankful, since i've gotten all my weather info from the app on my phone for years and years (or, occasionally, if i want to make myself feel more informed by looking at a radar map, [weather.com](http://weather.com)), for how anachronistic it seems to me that they are constantly referring to catching the weather on the news or seeing what the weatherman has to say. i'm thankful if watching weather reports delivered by a human being makes them feel more confident or secure, even though i think most weather reports are bullshit, no matter the source. i'm thankful when there are bad weather reports and then they don't come true—i'm thankful that the forecast predicted rain every day of d and i's vacation so far, but so far it only rained a bit yesterday afternoon. \n\ni'm thankful that though it's supposed to rain heavily today because of the tropical storm/hurricane, it hasn't started yet. i'm thankful that i might just be able to get out and get a run before it really gets going. i'm thankful that natural disasters have never really scared me, that the fear of death that gets to me is much smaller in scope. i'm thankful that we have enough food and water and movies and books. i'm thankful for d's interest in the hurricane shutters that everyone is pulling over their windows. i'm thankful to have learned from my dad while driving last night that covering your window with x's made of tape doesn't actually prevent the window from shattering. i'm thankful for faux-prophylactics, for the engineering of hope. i'm thankful for sandbags, both conceptually and in reality. \n\ni'm thankful that i haven't gotten as much work done on personal creative projects this vacation as i wanted to, and i'm thankful that i accept this and am mostly okay with it, even if it is a bit disappointing. i'm thankful that i've still managed to keep writing this, even though some days i haven't been in the mood. i'm thankful to have stayed up past my \"bedtime\" last night so that d and my parents could watch the new episode of _american horror story_ together. i'm thankful that while i really wanted to go into the guest bedroom and read in peace, i spent this extra hour with them, since i know there are only so many hours left for us to spend together (i'm thankful, though, to know that sometimes i need to be alone and that if i don't get enough alone time, the quality time i replace it with won't actually be quality). i'm thankful that before _american horror story_, we watched _the purge: election year_, which was not great but was still much better than _american horror story_. i'm thankful that the song over the credits was, of course, \"i'm afraid of americans.\" i'm thankful for high concept nonsense.\n\ni'm thankful for [this essay about ghosts and

images](https://twitter.com/cursedimages) twitter account—i'm thankful for the gestalt aura that can be generated by pairing a simple phrase with an image. i'm thankful that in the case of this account, the words \"cursed image\" and a random number take what would be strange but banal images and charge them with something otherworldly and dangerous. i'm thankful for [barthes' concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_Lucida_\\(book\\)) of the studium and the punctum. i'm thankful for the weirdness of this final line in that wikipedia entry: \"_Barthes died in an automobile accident soon after the publication of_ Camera Lucida, _and many have read the book as Barthes' eulogy for himself_.\" i'm thankful for [the episode of you made it

says she now knows what it's like to be dead and hear people eulogizing you at your own funeral.\n\ni'm thankful for this series of images depicting \"_[when u want affection but u don't like to ask
