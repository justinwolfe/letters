  "body": "i'm thankful that i had a dentist appointment this morning, so i don't really have much time to write these notes. i'm thankful that though i was a little slow getting out of bed, i was able to speed up my bike ride so as not to be late for the 8am appointment. i'm thankful that i had the same hygienist that i had at my last appointment. i'm thankful that she appreciated that i remembered the anecdote she told me at my last appointment about the old man who asked if she had scotch-flavored toothpaste. i'm thankful that because of her pleasant conversation, i was able to tune out cnn headline news, which was on the tv in the background. i'm thankful for her gentleness. i'm thankful that, curious how she was using her hook and mirror to measure my gum line, i asked her if there was a little ruler on there. i'm thankful she said yes and showed me the ruler, which has tiny ticks on it each millimeter. i'm thankful that when the dentist came in, he brought a dental student who was also named justin. i'm thankful that i told him (and them) that this was the best dentist's office i had ever been a patient of, so he was in the right place to learn. i'm thankful for how pleased that made all of them to hear and made me to say. i'm thankful, since i rode my bike and didn't wear a backpack, to have left the little goodie bag of dental accessories that i probably wouldn't use for someone else. i'm thankful that at the check-out desk, i paid out of pocket for the appointment since i don't have dental insurance anymore, which felt like a very adult thing to do. i'm thankful for the receptionist's laughter when i told her i hadn't ever noticed the cubbies where they store their street clothes in the back of the office. i'm thankful that i didn't have any cavities.",
