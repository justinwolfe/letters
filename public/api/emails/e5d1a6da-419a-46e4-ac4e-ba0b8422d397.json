  "body": "I'm thankful the weather is so nice and it isn't raining all the time and winter seems to be finally over. I'm thankful for the lift in mood that that gives me, which is important. \n\nI'm thankful for my dog, and thankful that he likes going running with me. I'm thankful for having started Couch to 5k and am on the second week. I'm thankful that I'm messing up my second week at it because it's making me realise how important being organised is. I'm thankful I've really been making an effort the last few days to be organised and get my shit together and get control of my life. I'm thankful for calendars, to do apps, day planners and my journal. I'm thankful for journaling.\n\nI'm thankful I found JW's newsletter because reading it gives me an insight into other people's lives and it makes me feel less alone. I'm thankful I started my own newsletter/tinyletter/thing because of it, even though I'm not really sure if people like it that much. I'm thankful for being unsure as to how much to share about my personal life in it, because family members subscribe to it. Being unsure about your public vs private selves is a thing to be thankful for - it always keeps you on your toes.\n\nI'm thankful that I'm afraid to go running because it's so warm today and what if I get too hot and die. I'm thankful that this is putting me off running. Maybe it's okay to spend two weeks doing one week's worth of training over and over. Maybe I'll do something else with my time instead of running, like writing, for example.\n\nI'm thankful that I just realised that I forgot to take my second daily dose of ritalin. I better go do that. Being organised is good.\n\n\\- jess (5/12/17). For writing, existential angst, feminism, creativity, getting shit done, and whatever you're having yourself: [https://tinyletter.com/jessicamaybury](https://tinyletter.com/jessicamaybury)\n\n[what are you thankful for?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
