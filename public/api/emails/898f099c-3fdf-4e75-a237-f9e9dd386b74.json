I'm thankful to Anna, my professor, and to all the students who contributed their thoughts and ideas to our group discussions. The historical and social context of literature is increasingly important and I'm thankful that this professor was not a by-the-book sort of person. I'm thankful to be asked, \"Like, how does it make you feel? Do you connect? Do you relate? Do you see ties to today, or to the basic universality of being human?\" I don't connect anymore, not in the way that once me feel something, and I'm thankful to recognize that something has changed. You know, I'm thankful to understand that I don't have to write.\n\nOh, and I'm thankful for the line of the class:\"'[Fred, that ole petrified man sure did leave me with a funny feelin](http://www.scott.kyschools.us/userfiles/1778/Classes/3014/OC%20Doc%20Eudora%20Welty%20and%20Petrified%20Man-0.pdf)'.\"I'm thankful that reading fiction is still rad.\n\nI'm thankful for YouTube videos about making engine repairs to a 1996 Jeep Cherokee, which taught me that I need to gauge and gap new spark plugs before I replace the old ones. I'm thankful for passed smog tests and hopeful dental check-ups. I'm thankful to see that [SPACEPLAN](http://jhollands.co.uk/spaceplan/) was released as a standalone game. I'm thankful that I can still play Skyrim and experience something I've never seen.\n\nI'm thankful for [Janelle Monáe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGRzz0oqgUE) and [Apollonia Saintclair](https://studiosaintclair.tumblr.com/). I'll thank you not to click those links at work, but thankful if you choose to check them out.\n\n\\- Vic (2). 5/19/18\n\n[previously](https://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/vic)\n\n[what are you thankful for?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
