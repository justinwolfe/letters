i'm thankful for the way emily models her appreciation for her excellence without also pulling any punches or dodging difficult questions (i'm thankful for the sweetbitter last line and to imagine watching an extreme close-up of elisabeth moss's face as she reads it, which would be exquisite (though really it would be exquisite to watch elsiabeth moss's face as she read the phone book or an eye chart or a takeout menu or basically anything)). i'm thankful for [this hilarious post in which sarah is a hater](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/all-the-people-youll-meet-in-city-parks-this-summer?utm_source=vicetwitterca) about annoying people in parks in the summer. i'm thankful for something really gross i think of when dogsitting/walking dogs, which is that when you pick up dog poop from the grass in someone's yard or the park you can never really get quite all of it, but you can get enough of it that a person probably wouldn't see it if they weren't looking out for it, so that then if that person sat in the grass or walked barefoot (two activities i enjoy) they might sit on the poop residue area:(. i'm thankful for [tactics](https://twitter.com/LarryWebsite/status/862308823679340544). i'm thankful for [this humorous use of corn holders](https://twitter.com/jennyjaffe/status/871997789659475969). i'm thankful for [this saucy comment about german baking](https://twitter.com/AliaM_H/status/872688645815361536).",
