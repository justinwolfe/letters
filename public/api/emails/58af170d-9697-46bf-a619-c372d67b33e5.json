The song was a pastiche of early 1970s Neil Young because Bowie was listening to a Neil Young record at home on 30 May 1971 when he got the news of the arrival of his son_.\"\n\ni'm thankful that it is world poetry day and i'm thankful that means that all through the social world today people will be decorating their hours with verses. i'm thankful for [pome](http://tinyletter.com/pome), which is my primary source of poetry these days and which provides perfectly curated and chosen short poems. i'm thankful for \"the circus\" by kenneth koch, which is my favorite poem, which you can read [here](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/237626) and listen to [here](https://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Koch/Koch-Kenneth_The-Circus_Appearing-on-The-Poetry-Foundation_2006.mp3) (it is best when listened to) and read my feelings about [here](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-1-31).\n\ni'm thankful that i facetimed my parents while i was waiting for d to get home for dinner yesterday. i'm thankful that while i was facetiming with them on my dad's phone, while they were in the car driving home from a short trip, my brother called on my mom's phone and we talked to each other through the speakerphones. i'm thankful that my brother announced he got a part in a play starting in may, which we were all happy to hear. i'm thankful that he is about to be in _hamlet_ starting soon and is either rosencrantz or guildenstern, i can't remember.",
