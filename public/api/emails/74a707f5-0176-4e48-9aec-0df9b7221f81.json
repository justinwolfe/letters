  "body": "i'm thankful to have had fun at d's company barbecue on tuesday. i'm thankful that though it was forecast to rain and there were at times some ominous clouds, the weather was great—it was 90 degrees, but not humid and with a soft breeze. i'm thankful to have gotten to see the dog we sat for last summer, who i feel great affection for, and i'm thankful he paid more attention to us than he did last time we visited. i'm thankful to have gotten to hang out with the keyboardist from the band i used to be in, who wants to start jamming again with him on drums and me on guitar, which is exciting. i'm thankful for cooler beer and for chocolate chip cookies. \n\ni'm thankful, since d has been doing various company retreat things the past week and a half, to have had some time to myself in the evenings, but i'm also thankful that the retreat is almost over so i will get to have her back in my life, since i have missed her.\n\ni'm thankful that at work yesterday rather than continue to avoid working on a pull request i had stalled out on, i admitted that i was lost and asked for help. i'm thankful to have gotten on a call with one of my favorite coworkers to answer questions she had about http requests. i'm thankful to have started refactoring the project i've been working on lately and to have gotten through a first pass reorganization of the modules associated with it without breaking anything—i'm thankful i'm now set up to start refactoring the rest of it piece by piece. i'm thankful that though there is not enough time to do everything i want as fast as i want, i haven't been working overtime.\n\ni'm thankful for [this thread about UIs that amass memories](https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/996056615928266752). i'm thankful for [this review of a game](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/05/15/medieval-shopkeeper-simulator-review-early-access/#more-543203) about being a medieval shopkeeper. i'm thankful to have finally read [that _new yorker_ article about japanese family rentals](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/japans-rent-a-family-industry), which was great. \n\ni'm thankful that because it was raining yesterday, i had to run in the garage on the treadmill, even though i hate running on the treadmill, because it made me appreciate how nice it's been to run outside every day lately. i'm thankful that though the pollen is bad and it feels like my zyrtec isn't as effective as it used to be, there are other allergy medications. i'm thankful for the way i sweat while running in the summer, for how the sweat makes visible the effects of the exercise. i'm thankful for how good a glass of cold water tastes after a run in the sun.",
