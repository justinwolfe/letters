  "body": "i'm thankful that, after leaving the last few episodes hanging for a while because we couldn't take it anymore, we caught up and watched the end of the current season of _the handmaid's tale_. i'm thankful for something i appreciate formally about the show, which is the amount of times a scene ends with a long extreme closeup of elisabeth moss's face. i'm thankful for the passion of joan of arc of these codas, each of which is the same in terms of content (a long extreme closeup of elisabeth moss's face) but i'm thankful that because of the depth of her performance, each one of those shots feels wholly unique and individual, a living sculpture representing that slowly evolves through micro-movements of the face and eyes and breath. i'm thankful that though the plot end of the season finale, after some really strong momentum in the last couple of episodes, was imo incredibly stupid and is the kind of thing i'd point to as an argument for tv's endless, zombie-like seriality being a bug not a feature (even though for other shows i will sometimes argue the opposite), i will keep watching the show next season because i can't stop watching her.",
