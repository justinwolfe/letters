which have a lovely oval shape and are a peachy orange. i'm thankful for elizabeth gumport's series of [photos of beautiful pill designs](https://www.google.com/search?q=elizabeth+gumport+pills&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS732US733&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg0-r28IPWAhXJbiYKHWffBEUQ7AkIMg&biw=1449&bih=840). i'm thankful for the bizarre stock image for this article about \"[mouth taping for better sleep](https://askthedentist.com/mouth-tape-better-sleep/).\" i'm thankful to have realized that when i get really involved in work i have a tendency to mouth breathe and not realize it for a while until i snap out of my trance and find myself with a dry mouth and a sense of fatigue, which i know isn't good, so i have started taping my mouth shut while i work (i'm thankful that my work is done from home and rarely requires speaking) in order to try to train myself out of this. i'm also thankful to have tried it while i slept last night. i'm thankful to know that it is weird but to not care.\n\ni'm thankful that though work has been kind of crazy because of a large number of my coworkers being out sick, we've been getting through it and it will be better next week. i'm thankful that the project i'm working on now has given/is giving me the opportunity to learn lots of new things (setting up a domain for a server, using nginx and cron and forever, getting and setting up an SSL certificate. i'm thankful that doing the things i'm doing now would have felt impossible a year ago but i'm thankful that it only feels like a fun challenge right now. i'm thankful that i get time to work on my own projects, since solving a puzzle you've made for yourself is a nice change from what i normally do, which is solving the puzzles that other people give you / helping them to be able to solve them themselves (i'm thankful that's rewarding too, but thankful to have variety). \n\ni'm thankful to have scheduled time off in october so d and i can visit my parents before they go on their around the world journey. i'm thankful that i will get to fulfill my lifelong dream of going to an amusement park while stoned. i'm thankful to have realized that the last time i went to an amusement park was more than a decade ago—i'm thankful to be intrigued about how different it will feel. i'm thankful for smartphones, which i have to imagine will make the line waiting experience more pleasant than i remember it being (not that i honestly remember it being that bad when i was a kid). i'm thankful to hope that while we're there we can find some of the old home videos of when we went to disney world when i was a kid, since my memories of that are mostly just the videos. i'm thankful for the concept of physical memory.\n\ni'm thankful for this week's episode of _insecure_, which was vulgar and wonderful. i'm thankful that the soundtrack included [the new miguel song](https://open.spotify.com/album/0RiesdDeJQc9PbAs7iwodq), which i wasn't sure about when i first heard but am starting to really like now, and i'm thankful for the soundtrack in general (and for sites like [this one](http://www.player.one/every-song-insecure-season-2-episode-6-hella-blows-119576))(i'm thankful that the song length is 4:20, which is such a silly miguel thing to do). i'm thankful that after dinner last night d and i watched both videos for the calvin harris/pharrell/katy perry/big sean song \"feels\" (this is [the better one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWPHy-NfAW0)). i'm thankful for katy perry's bizarre but endearing hyperrealistic gwen stefani pastiche and for pharrell's immortal elven appearance (i'm thankful that we also watched a karaoke video of the song). i'm thankful for the video for \"[boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPRy1B4t5YA)\" by charli xcx (and also for the song, which is perfectly precisely produced). i'm thankful for lorde's VMA performance of \"[homemade dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4hUmKZvBBE),\" which reminds me of the oa and tai chi and the kind of free joy children can feel in moving their bodies.\n\ni'm thankful for the weird fruit and tea popsicles i got at the supermarket, which are too much tea and not enough fruit but are still good. i'm thankful that we have had some really good tangerines this week. i'm thankful that the cable company finally came and buried the cable for our internet in the yard (i'm thankful to have been amazed at how quickly they did it. i'm thankful to have been reading _[priestdaddy](https://www.amazon.com/Priestdaddy-Memoir-Patricia-Lockwood-ebook/dp/B01L8C4W98/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504266797&sr=8-1&keywords=priestdaddy)_ by patricia lockwood, which is wonderful. i'm thankful to be amazed, having never really read her prose, only her poetry, for how much perverse magic she manages to fit into every single sentence. i'm thankful to look forward to reading more tonight.",
