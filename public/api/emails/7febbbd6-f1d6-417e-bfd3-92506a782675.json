(i'm thankful to worry it might sound \\*too\\* boring.) i'm thankful to have begun typing other things i was thankful for but erased them because they felt both too personal and also disingenuous. i'm thankful to recognize that wanting recognition doesn't feel like a good or true enough reason for me to seek it. i'm thankful to admit to myself when i'm trying too hard and, hopefully, to stop.\n\ni'm thankful to actually be pretty excited by pie.\n\n\\- J",
