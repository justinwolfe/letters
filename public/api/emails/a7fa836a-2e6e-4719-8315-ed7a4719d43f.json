i'm thankful that this felt responsible, like i had accomplished something.\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday i cleaned up the kitchen counters, which she had emptied her purse onto on tuesday night and which over the course of the past week's accumulations of trash and dirty dishes during my sleepwalk through life, had gotten to look like something out of hoarders, and that this afternoon i will vacuum and mop the floors, which always seems like a big ordeal that's going to take a long time but really isn't, since our house isn't that big. i'm thankful for the peace i feel when things are clean and neat. i'm thankful that i'm able to feel peace, at least some of the time, since i know that's not true of everyone.",
