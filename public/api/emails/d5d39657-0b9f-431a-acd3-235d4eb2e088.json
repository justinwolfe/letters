I need to relax and let things go. I should experiment with drugs. These thoughts were not unusual for me. I put Astral Weeks on the stereo in the living room and slumped right onto the floor to listen. Though I was trying not to dwell on the play, I found myself thinking about Nick onstage yelling: I don't want to lean on your shoulder, I want my crutch.

In the message he promised to send about my work, he described a particular image as 'beautiful'. It was probably true to say that I had found Nick's performance in the play 'beautiful', though I wouldn't have written that in an email. Then again his performance was related to the physicality of his existence in a way that a poem, typed in a standard font and forwarded on by someone else, was not. At a certain level of abstraction, anyone could have written the poem, but that didn't feel true either. It seemed as though what he was really saying was: there's something beautiful about the way you think and feel, or the way that you experience the world is beautiful in some way. This remark returned to me repeatedly for days after the email arrived. I smiled involuntarily when I thought of it, like I was remembering a private joke._\n\ni'm thankful that though i had a very bad time mentally on saturday night for some reason, i felt better yesterday and today. i'm thankful that last week i had a genetic test to see what antidepressants might be best for me to try if i change from the one i'm on now since that one doesn't seem to be working as well (at least at the dosage i'm on), which may be a scammy upsell given my googling but which i can afford (i'm thankful for that) and which if it potentially prevents me from going up on and going down from a medication that won't work well for me would be worth it to me. i'm thankful for the privilege of being able to decide something potentially costly is \"_worth the money_,\" which is not an option most people have.\n\ni'm thankful for [this mesmerizing 26 minute video](http://www.avclub.com/article/2017s-most-avant-garde-documentary-was-filmed-insi-257277) of the electronics section of a department store in the 90s. i'm thankful for [this absolutely perfect diptych](https://twitter.com/TabloidArtHist/status/803354827375816704) of a photo of kim/north/kanye and _las meninas_ (and for the [tabloid art history](https://twitter.com/TabloidArtHist) account in general). i'm thankful for [nadiya](https://twitter.com/BegumNadiya/status/886303632488099841), who we do not deserve. i'm thankful for [good views](https://katherinerosewrites.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/in-celebration-of-a-good-view/). i'm thankful for [this demonstration of old fashioned compositing](https://twitter.com/silentmoviegifs/status/885925092315869184). i'm thankful for [this owen wilson impression](https://twitter.com/petergilroy/status/883794770748874752), which is a happy way to start your monday, as is this video. i'm thankful for [things that are better soft](https://twitter.com/danaanmm/status/885905897410703363).",
