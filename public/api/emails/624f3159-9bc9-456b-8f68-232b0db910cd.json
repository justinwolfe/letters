Thankful that the streets flood and people run for their cars as if such a thing has never happened, as if water breaking from the heavens is not to be immersed in, as if each of us was not immersed in a wet heaven we can scarcely imagine now.\n\nI'm thankful for corners where I can manufacture what delights me in the making of, any untroubled span of time will do. Even if they are only words.\n\nI'm thankful for our animals: Chihuahua yap dog, increasingly senile cat, squirrel fallen from his nest, hurt, five years go (can it be). For all the animals that have come and gone and will come.\n\nI'm thankful for life's roar, for everything around me in the place I seldom leave. Stacks of books, the walls that contain us, shadowy presences. Cold water glugged in the night after waking from a dream of some vast foreign plateau.\n\nI'm thankful for everything that took the place of what I missed out on. For the furies that drove me stupidly when younger and the regrets that rake me in age. I'm thankful for what I got to feel and know before I had to go.   \n\n\\- randy (8/15/17).\n\nwhat are you thankful for? [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp\\_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/)",
