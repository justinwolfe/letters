(i’m thankful for the format of these thank-you notes, which forces me to talk about things that infuriate me in such a way that they are ultimately couched in gratitude--a difficult but useful exercise.)\n\ni’m thankful to not be the same girl i was at 22, which feels like a lifetime ago. i’m thankful that when we ended it, i didn’t burst into anything, though i’m not sure if my lack of bursting has to do more with maturity or just exhaustion. i’m thankful to claudia rankine for helping me understand that exhaustion is a kind of emptiness and i’m thankful to joni mitchell for helping me understand that emptiness is a kind of freedom. i’m thankful for having absolutely nothing left to spill.\n\n\\- k (12/24/2016).\n\npreviously: [1](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-k), [2](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-k-2)",
