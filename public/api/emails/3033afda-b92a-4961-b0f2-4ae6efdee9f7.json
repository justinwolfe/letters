  "body": "i'm thankful for the local urgent care chain where d and i had our doctor appointments yesterday. i'm thankful for how fast and efficient they were and i'm thankful it was no problem to get a renewal of my psych meds. i'm thankful that though i initially said i did not want a flu shot, i overcame my inner fear and got that and a tetanus shot (which i couldn't remember if i had had) and neither of them really hurt at all. i'm thankful to have gotten blood drawn and to have talked to the blood draw tech about varieties of oreos while she did the deed. i'm thankful that d and i's appointments finished at exactly the same time. i'm thankful to have confirmed that my height is 5'8\", which as i have probably told you before i can never remember when asked (i'm thankful that writing it down in this way will probably help me remember it better). i'm thankful i have good insurance that covered everything.\n\ni'm thankful for the new season of _bojack horseman,_ which is predictably bleak and amazing (and actually, so far at least, there is a little hard won hope among the bleakness, which is a nice new flavor). i'm thankful for how hard d laughed at a _brokeback mountain_ reference that i didn't get. i'm thankful for how good the show is at visual density, stacking the screen with gags. i'm thankful for the way multiple versions of the self overlapping like palimpsests was used to depict princess caroline's burnout, which was a very resonant enactment. i'm thankful for todd jokes.\n\ni'm thankful for the us version of _the office_, which i think and hope i am just always going to find to be TV macaroni and cheese, the most comforting of comfort foods. i'm thankful that i can always dip into that and find occasion to laugh. i'm thankful for the episode i chose last night, where michael and holly and darryl are driving holly's things to nashua and then michael and holly break up and on the way back, darryl tries to get michael to sing the blues but michael doesn't understand he's supposed to sing lyrics and so just echos daryll singing the \"ba dunna dun uh\" accompaniment and i'm thankful for the sweet moment of the two of them doing this back and forth.\n\ni'm thankful that there is a new earl sweatshirt album. i'm thankful for fun size candy bars and for the mix we have (reese's, almond joy, kit kat, hershey) from the after halloween sale. i'm thankful that yesterday at work i was able to get the thing i wanted to get released released, even though it was a struggle, and i'm thankful i had a nice pairing with the kind engineer where he told me how sometimes he worries he's not being helpful enough to me and i told him how i sometimes feel apprehensive about not using the time he gives me as efficiently as possible; i'm thankful always when i feel comfortable enough with another person that we can just tell each other the truth about our feelings.",
