But I love how so many people around the world can get so madly excited and invested in watching a bunch of people try to bake all these crazy things under a time pressure. People get so emotionally involved and I absolutely love that. It just makes me smile thinking of all the people, with all their reactions, as the baked goods make it or break it. It's just beautiful.\n\n\\- Scarlett (09/22/2016).\n\npreviously: [1](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-s)",
