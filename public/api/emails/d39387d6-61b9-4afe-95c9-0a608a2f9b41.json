  "body": "i'm thankful to apologize that these notes are a bit late today. i'm thankful to be writing them from the very large and comfortable sofa of the house where we are house-sitting for the next week. i'm thankful for the dog who came with the house and who is such a good boy. i'm thankful for how happy he was when we got to the house and let him out of the garage. i'm thankful that like in a dog in a children's story if you pick up a random stick and throw it he will go fetch it. i'm thankful to have let the chickens out of their coop into their wire pen and to have fed and watered them and collected four eggs. i'm thankful to hope that the extra zyrtec i took will help with my cat allergies, since i recently discovered that benadryl, which i once considered the poor-man's benzo, now makes me anxious. i'm thankful to hope i do not spend the whole week itching and sniffling, especially because this is a very nice house. i'm thankful to have the wifi password and that we will be able to get the password for the computer with the VR headset. i'm thankful that that right now the dog is napping at my feet.\n\ni'm thankful for the computerized kiosk at the grocery store for ordering things from the deli which helps to avoid that awkward exchange that happens when they bring you a slice of the meat on a piece of wax paper so you can check the thickness and then if you eat it you suddenly have a ham taste in your mouth and a piece of greasy wax paper and if you don't that feels weird in its own way and then you have to go through it multiple times if you're buying multiple meats which if i am in the deli i always am. i'm thankful for flavored seltzer and i'm thankful for the giant package of store brand fig newtons i bought in an attempt to make myself eat less dessert by buying dessert that i don't want to eat that much. i'm thankful for the chocolate ice cream full of chunks of chocolate and ribbons of liquid chocolate we had for dessert last night. i'm thankful for the leftover chinese food we had for dinner. i'm thankful for fried rice. i'm thankful that our chinese restaurant of choice does both the \"authentic\" chinese food i want and the americanized chinese food d loves (i'm thankful that on their menu, orange chicken is called \"orange flavored chicken\").\n\ni'm thankful that [this picture of strawberries](https://twitter.com/selectall/status/840731970879528960) doesn't have any red pixels. i'm thankful for [this guided meditation about french fries](https://twitter.com/RuthCurry/status/840907359337762816). i'm thankful for [good samaritans](https://twitter.com/FreshLee_Baked/status/840384298486267906). i'm thankful for [the x-files intro with the golden girls theme song](https://twitter.com/BigRadMachine/status/837164214456307712). i'm thankful [to hope my taste isn't changing](https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/111127611148742656). i'm thankful for how much japanese people [love putting buttholes on things](https://twitter.com/tinydinosaurs/status/840773646624800768). i'm thankful for [this podcast on pooing featuring phoebe waller-bridge of fleabag](http://www.on-soap.com/guilt-and-shame/2016/12/15/jpymaks867l0av7pgmoal4784bauyl). i'm thankful to have never really liked lorde but to really love [the new lorde song,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvJaNeELic) which (maybe because of something about the meter) reminds me of [yoshimi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzlMeTxVdH8). i'm thankful that [i don't need no frauds](https://open.spotify.com/track/0WtVtCK5SEFvyyA5V8D9CI). i'm thankful for [chanel](https://open.spotify.com/album/6OGzmhzHcjf0uN9j7dYvZH). i'm thankful that [david letterman is on an SSRI](http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html). i'm thankful for [derrida](https://twitter.com/immolations/status/825325708968857600) (though i'm thankful for _seinfeld_ also) and i'm thankful for [detournement](https://twitter.com/BethElderkin/status/840931014012764160). i'm thankful there is [a new way to mute people on twitter](https://twitter.com/chillmage/status/840748275267436545).\n\ni'm thankful that we finished watching all 46 episodes of _terrace house: boys and girls in the city_, which is a greatest of all time tv show for me. i'm thankful that we have _terrace house: aloha state_ to watch now, even though it doesn't seems as immediately promising. i'm thankful for lauren, who is my favorite after one episode. i'm thankful that last night we watched the first two episodes of _big little lies_. i'm thankful to feel so far like it's dumb but that i enjoy watching it. i'm thankful to have been reminded of when _gone girl_ was in season and somebody (probably j\\*nn\\*f\\*r w\\*\\*n\\*r? tho idk) compared it to jonathan franzen and i read a chapter and was like \"nope\" (even though i didn't like his most recent book at all bc it felt like he likes nell zink so much he tried to write a nell zink book and could not do that well because he is jonathan franzen and needs to write jonathan franzen books and couldn't even finish it) and closed the book, whereas this feels like what i wanted that to be, which is this very particular and satisfying blend of camp and melodrama and social detail. i'm thankful for reese witherspoon and i'm thankful for [orin](https://twitter.com/orin_anne) who [noticed something about the card](https://twitter.com/spencerpratt/status/840617512047861760) for the tequila oprah sent her.\n\ni'm thankful for a really great band practice on friday. i'm thankful that though i was apprehensive because our previous practice was a bit rocky, we gelled really well and had a lot of fun together. i'm thankful that we jammed more than we have in the past and i'm thankful for a disco goof we did that i think actually sounded good and want to return to. i'm thankful we hung a room mic to document the rehearsal and to be listening to the recording of the rehearsal now, which is silly but entertaining. i'm thankful that the drummer and i are facing each other as we play and often crack each other up. i'm thankful that while we were breaking down our gear, we talked about awkward breakups and i was reminded of how the first time i got drunk my freshman year of college and at like 2 in the morning sent my \"intro to film\" teacher an email about how i was drunk and in love with this girl who was in film school with me and then woke up in the morning and was mortified to realize what i had done and sent the teacher another email saying how embarrassed i was and her very politely responding and saying she hadn't received it even though it had quite plainly gone to her. i'm thankful for the latest [brainball](http://tinyletter.com/brainball), which has some great crush stories. i'm thankful for [weekends](https://twitter.com/tambourine/status/840620468847677440).",
