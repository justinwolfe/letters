  "body": "i'm thankful that thought i had the volume on my alarm too low, d heard it and woke me up. i'm thankful to have set it three minutes earlier to give me time to microwave a bowl of oatmeal for myself instead of cereal. i'm thankful that it is cold enough in the mornings for me to want oatmeal again. i'm thankful for cinnamon and for maple syrup. i'm thankful for the dessert d made last night, which was this very good apple cake that we had at a friend's party once and got the recipe for:\n\n_1 3/4 cups sugar, divided (I used white and brown, a mix b/c I was running out)_\n\n_1 stick butter, softened (I used about 7 tablespoons--already had used some of the end)_\n\n_1 teaspoon vanilla extract_\n\n_6 ounces block-style fat-free cream cheese, softened (about 3/4 cup)_\n\n_2 large eggs_ \n\n_1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour_ \n\n_1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder_\n\n_1/4 teaspoon salt_\n\n_2 teaspoons ground cinnamon_\n\n_3 cups chopped peeled Rome apple (about 2 large) I used jonagold. all are good, really_\n\n_Cooking spray_\n\n_1\\. Put the oven at 350_\n\n_2\\. Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar, margarine, vanilla, and cream cheese  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to creamed mixture. I just add flour on top, and powder and salt on top of that. Mix the dry a tad while its on top and keep mixing._\n\n_3\\. Combine 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon. Combine cinnamon mixture and apple in a bowl, and stir apple mixture into batter. Pour batter into an 8-inch springform pan (or a 9x9 square) coated with cooking spray_\n\n_4\\. Bake 55 minutes. The recipe says an hour and 10 but I only do 55. It should be done then._\n\ni'm thankful for the cake, which is moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. i'm thankful (again, in a different context) for cinnamon. i'm thankful that yesterday, when i was prepping dinner (chorizo tacos, fried corn, saffron rice, fruit salad), i kept passing the table where the cake was sitting to cool and getting a whiff of the smell of it and feeling intoxicated by the sweetness. i'm thankful to have cut us slightly larger than usual portions for dessert, even though that means the cake won't last as long. i'm thankful that if we still want more of the cake after we finish it (which we probably will), d will make another one.\n\ni'm thankful that i considered trying to catch up on work over the weekend but decided against it and didn't even open my work computer. i'm thankful to have given myself that peace and that distance, even if it might make today a bit harder. i'm thankful that at the end of last week we got to a level of busyness where i was able to detach myself from my anxiety and stress about it a bit, because there was so clearly only so much i or anyone on my team could do to face the mountain of tickets. i'm thankful that though we've had team members out for the past three weeks, we are all back this week, which will hopefully help make everything feel less crazy. i'm thankful that it is possible (at least for me) to feel disenchanted and hopeful at the same time.\n\ni'm thankful that i cleaned and refilled the humidifier in our bedroom. i'm thankful to have done two loads of laundry and brewed a large quantity of strong chamomile tea. i'm thankful to have clean sheets. i'm thankful that the company that sold us defective incense cones sent a replacement package thanks to d's hard work and am thankful that these cones burn well and smell interesting, unlike any incense i've had before. i'm thankful that i can't quite decide what book i want to read now, but am thankful that i'll settle on something soon i'm sure. i'm thankful that the top contenders right now are _[crosstalk](https://www.amazon.com/Crosstalk-Connie-Willis-ebook/dp/B00WPQ98JG)_ and [_future sex_](https://www.amazon.com/Future-Sex-Emily-Witt-ebook/dp/B01D8F6502/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1477309837&sr=1-1&keywords=future+sex), though there are always other possibilities. i'm thankful there are always other possibilities.\n\ni'm thankful for the most recent episode of _the great debates_, in which megan amram debates whether \"[The Hamburglar Is One Of The Three Best Things About McDonald's](http://greatdebates69.podbean.com/).\" i'm thankful for the new '[search party](https://soundcloud.com/channel33/ep-197-search-party-with-cathy-lew-and-brendan-lynch)' podcast from the ringer. i'm thankful for the intelligence and humor of the hosts (but am thankful that the podcast isn't \"wacky\" like so many) and am thankful to have learned about some really interesting internet things, including [8booth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYLSVe5VcdYpffBm64O-mA/videos) (a southern california man who breaks into hotels and private clubs and climbs to their roofs, then leaps off into small bodies of water, all of this captured on a gopro) and [bread face](https://www.instagram.com/breadfaceblog/?hl=en) (a brooklyn woman who buries her face into assorted baked goods, this action paired with a song playing in the background). i'm thankful that both 8booth and bread face, before they dive into the body of their activity, always have a moment, a brief pause where they take a breath and prepare themselves for what they're going to do. i'm thankful for the opportunity to take a breath and prepare myself for what i'm going to do.",
