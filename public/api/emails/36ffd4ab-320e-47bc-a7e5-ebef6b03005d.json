  "body": "i'm thankful that we were able to come back home on saturday afternoon rather than sunday afternoon. i'm thankful that though our connection in atlanta was very tight, we made it in plenty of time. i'm thankful d had stashed some kind bars in her bag (i'm thankful for the almond and coconut flavor) which sustained us until we could eat a proper late lunch at the airport mcdonalds after landing in indianapolis. i'm thankful for the wad of cash my dad tucked into my running shorts, which i tried to give back (as i always do) but which was very helpful for paying the surprisingly large airport parking bill. i'm thankful that on the ride home, my phone battery lasted on a single digit charge so that we could pass the time listening to frank ocean and chelsea peretti\n\ni'm thankful to have had a day to decompress and readjust to being home. i'm thankful that before we left, though the temperature in the mornings had dropped a bit, it was still fundamentally summer and thankful that being in miami for a week intensified the sense, on our return, that it is now fall. i'm thankful for leaves changing color and for their slow motion flutters to the ground. i'm thankful that the cicadas and the crickets have stopped making their noises and i'm thankful that we've almost stopped needing to run the air conditioners—i'm thankful that soon enough i'll be able to take them out and put them down in the basement. i'm thankful for d changing from cardigan to sweater and then just covering herself in our faux-fur throw. i'm thankful for the throw, which is so comfortable and which we haven't been able to use for a long time. \n\ni'm thankful that though i maybe lost d's old 3ds and definitely lost my new kindle on our flight home, that's okay. i'm thankful, occasionally, to actually lose things since it makes my usual constant fear of losing things (even though i don't usually lose things) feel justified and even productive. i'm thankful that d has a new 3ds for herself and that i have an old kindle. i'm thankful to have been trying to read a book on my phone yesterday and struggling with distraction in a way that i don't with a single-use device like the kindle. i'm thankful for _[death's end](https://www.amazon.com/Deaths-End-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765377101/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1476100311&sr=8-1&keywords=death%27s+end)_, which i finished on the plane and which was totally incredible. i'm thankful for julia leigh's _[disquiet](https://www.amazon.com/Disquiet-Julia-Leigh-ebook/dp/B001JNJDUA/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1476100383&sr=1-3&keywords=disquiet)_, which is the book i started last night before falling asleep and which i am enjoying so far (i'm thankful for the sentence \"_The ugly countryside was momentarily interrupted by the small ugly village_.\").\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday afternoon i got on my work computer and caught up on emails and notifications and what's been going on in general. i'm thankful to have known that i didn't _have_ to do this, but i'm thankful to have done so in the hope of making my transition back to work today a bit easier. i'm thankful, even though i spent too much free time working on it, to have made a small tool to help my team deal with a changes in our service, which i hope will be helpful. i'm thankful for all the helpful jquery functions you can chain together to jankily traverse through the DOM. i'm thankful to use a variable in brackets to select an object key. i'm thankful for the satisfaction of building a small thing that works. i'm thankful to have shared with my coworkers in a semi-private channel the lyrics to a parody version of \"say my name\" targeted to our company/industry.\n\ni'm thankful to have learned from someone on twitter (can't remember now) and confirmed via [this awl article](https://theawl.com/eat-the-skin-e1881c0cbbdd#.af1oafr5p) that you can eat the skin of a kiwi the same way you would eat the skin of a peach. i'm thankful that this feels very strange on your first bite, like you're eating a piece of a stubbly face, but that this fades and then the contrast of the skin with the flesh feels nice and tastes good. i'm thankful for the apple fritters that i bought from the sale rack in the kroger bakery, even though i probably didn't need to eat two of them in one sitting. i'm thankful to have tried mantra meditation for the first time. i'm thankful that [lana del rey majored in philosophy](https://twitter.com/audreams/status/785221392820076544).",
