I’m thankful to be in a completely different place than I was when I wrote you the first letter and that it’s a little bit better now, but still has it’s difficulties that are difficult in a way I’ve never experience difficulty before. I’m thankful to sorta feel like an adult now even though I still feel young in a humiliating way at times. I’m thankful that the hobby I picked up when I was writing you the first time is something I still love and work on and that I take a lot more seriously now. I’m thankful that I understand what my mom went through working long hours at a minimum wage jobs to raise me as a child because I currently work two jobs and sleep very little. I’m thankful to have fallen in love again. I’m thankful I fell in love with a boy because I never thought that was possible and I love to experience new things even though I miss girls sometimes. I’m thankful my hair has grown longer than it has been in seven years even though I will probably shave my head again because my hair gives me acne. I’m thankful to be making my own money. I’m thankful to be making a little extra so I can treat myself to nice things sometimes. I’m thankful this boy I love really likes me back too even though I sometimes feel confused about how he shows that to me. I’m thankful my thought process is a mess still, even years after trying to get myself out of it, because I feel like it’s a very big part of what makes me, me and I don’t like losing parts of myself. I’m thankful for these new jeans I’m wearing because they fit me around the waist and most jeans don’t because I have no hips to hold them up. I’m thankful for Saturday nights. I’m thankful for asmr helping me fall asleep. I’m thankful for chocolate milk and candy getting me through the day. I’m thankful I am still strange to people even though people calling me strange makes me feel sad sometimes because they’re usually being mean when they say it. I’m thankful for King Krule and the warmth of the air after the sun sets. I’m thankful to know the smell of another person so well. I’m thankful to be alive even though I am always scared of the unknown.\n\n\\- kssndr (5/22/18). kssndr is a lonely 22 year old\n\n[previously](https://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/tyn-k)\n\n[what are you thankful for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
