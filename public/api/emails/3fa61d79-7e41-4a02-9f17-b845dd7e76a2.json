I'm thankful that I'm still going. I'm thankful that you're still going too.\n\n\\- sarah (8/26/17). [@sarah\\_\\_\\_waldron](https://twitter.com/sarah___waldron)\n\n[what are you thankful for?](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true)",
