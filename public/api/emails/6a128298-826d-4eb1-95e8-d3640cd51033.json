  "body": "i'm thankful that i went to the doctor this morning to increase my prozac dosage. i'm thankful that there's still runway for me with prozac in terms of upping my dosage, which has been the most effective antidepressant i've taken, and i'm thankful i was able to easily get a walk-in appointment this morning to take care of it and that the NP i saw was friendly and had ideas for other things to try if the increased dosage doesn't do the trick. i'm thankful i have good insurance and i'm thankful for the hope i felt when the appointment was over.\n\ni'm thankful that though my bike ride to the doctor's office was rainy, my coat is water resistant and i'm thankful that when i got out of the appointment with my new prescription in hand, the rain had stopped and the sun was shining, which is pathetic fallacy but i'll take it wherever i can get it. i'm thankful for something i know i have been thankful for before but am always thankful for, which is the reduced friction of riding on wet streets. i'm thankful to live in such a bikeable and bike-friendly city.\n\ni'm thankful for sourdough bread and butter and honey, which i had with some canned smoked oysters for lunch and which is such a perfect combination of foods. i'm thankful for the surprise gift d got me when we were out shopping yesterday of a set of drinking vinegars, which are delicious and refreshing additions to my seltzer. i'm thankful that this week we're having mapo tofu and another round of the smitten kitchen lentil sausage kale soup (i'm thankful to remind myself to get an extra can of tomatoes to make it stretch a little longer).\n\ni'm thankful, even though it's sad that redbox is stopping renting games, that they were selling off their inventory and i got a copy of a game i had started as a rental and enjoyed (_metro exodus_) a while ago for 13 dollars. i'm thankful to be okay with not beating _control,_ which i have been stuck in the penultimate boss battle of for several days (i'm thankful to know that if i go out and grind a bit more to upgrade some skills, it might be more feasible, but i'm also thankful to not feel that i have to treat a video game as work).\n\ni'm thankful that we had an impromptu lunch with k and t yesterday; i'm thankful for pho and i'm thankful for frozen yogurt. i'm thankful for _i, tonya_, which t recommended and we watched last night and really enjoyed. i'm thankful that i listened to the _you're wrong about_ episodes about tonya harding on the treadmill this morning, since they provided some interesting context. i'm thankful to have some new books to read, since i've had a hard time digging into anything lately. i'm thankful to play fetch with miso.",
