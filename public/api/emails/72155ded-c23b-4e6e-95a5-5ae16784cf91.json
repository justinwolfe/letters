But what engaged Bellini was not light, which, destroying darkness, enables us to distinguish one object from another; it was, rather, the way that, when light is diffused, it creates a unity of all the objects that it falls on. This is the reason, for instance, why a whole room, or a whole landscape, looks quite different at eleven o'clock in the morning from what it looks like at three o'clock in the afternoon. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Bellini's real interest was daylight. Light in this sense implies space. It isn't just a spark or a flame; it's a whole day. And so the struggle in his life was to create in his paintings the space that could hold and contain all that we mean by daylight._\"\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday afternoon it was so sunny out that i wanted to go on a bike ride and i got dressed up and packed a water and a granola bar in my biking backpack and headed out and got about three blocks before i realized that despite the warm colors of the afternoon light it was too cold and turned around and went home and ran on the treadmill instead. i'm thankful for [march fadness](http://www.marchfadness.com/past-games/). i'm thankful for [jens lekman](http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/03/01/517911676/jens-lekman-will-see-himself-now?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=nprmusic&utm_term=music&utm_content=20170301). i'm thankful for this nice [painting of 2 chainz](https://twitter.com/ohsalad_days/status/837913204244230144). i'm thankful for the movie _tickled_ (and the short sequel, _the tickle king_), which is apparently a documentary about a subculture of videos of men tickling each other and the shadowy figure funding these \"tickle cells.\" i'm thankful it is on _hbo go_ if you want to watch it. i'm thankful for terrace house, which we only have a few episodes of left and which is just the best show; i'm thankful for the bizarre discussions the panel has, like the one in a previous episode where two of the older panelists reminiscence about the excitement of young love and one of the women touches the breast of a younger woman to try it absorb her sexual energy. i'm thankful for the subsequent episode, where the same panelist talks about ointment fetish and confesses to wanting to give a man an enema. i'm thankful that the hilarious and strange conversations the panel has about the show are juxtaposed by these incredibly powerful and tense tiny human moments in the lives of the young people in the terrace house, which we are able to witness on the other side of the screen. i'm thankful for [time crystals](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ok-wtf-is-a-time-crystal). i'm thankful for thelonious monk's solo rendition of \"[these foolish things (remind me of you).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Uv1iIQEiqk)\"",
