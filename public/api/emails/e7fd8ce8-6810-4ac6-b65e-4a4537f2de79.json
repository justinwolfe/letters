Please go to the \"Beneficiary Setup\" page and \"Delete\" your old Spouse. Then, return to here and enter your new Spouse_\"), which feels like a little george saunders story. i'm thankful, remembering periods when i was a kid and my dad was between jobs and so we were between insurance and my mom would say, half joking/half anxious, \"be extra careful!\" to my brother and i. i'm thankful to recognize that this memory, combined with my anxiety of poverty and generalized hypochondria, has me buy more insurance than i need (as a person with a heart defect and mental health issues who is otherwise healthy) since that feels less scary than ending up with less than i need, and i'm thankful that i can afford to indulge my fears to a certain extent. i'm thankful, for now at least, to not have to be afraid for money reasons when i go to the doctor (since i have plenty of other reasons i am afraid). i'm thankful to hope that in the next few years we elect legislators and a president who make it so going to the doctor without having to be afraid of costs isn't just a privilege enjoyed by a minority of knowledge workers like me, but something that is equally shared.\n\ni'm thankful for phoenix down, the item you use in final fantasy games to resurrect party members who died in battle, for how i thought for a long time that the \"down\" referred to the dead party members (\"down on the ground\"), but i found out yesterday actually refers to [the feathers of the phoenix](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Phoenix_Down), its down.",
