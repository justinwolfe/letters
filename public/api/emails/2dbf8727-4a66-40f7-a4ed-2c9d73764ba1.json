PAY ATTENTION!!_\"\n\non the flip side of the cringe, though, i'm glad i still have the song (that is the underlying point of this series PAY ATTENTION (to me)). i think the song has its virtues including the nice kinda midwestern emo (i never listened to midwestern emo) guitar riff and the mellotron choir in the chorus and the instrumental break with a sample of (i think) a radio interview with my undergraduate creative writing professor (idk ðŸ¤·), but the thing i am thinking of in particular is the lyrics of the last bridge (which structurally does a trick i like with bridges where you've heard a bridge a few times in a song before a chorus and then it's like _after_ a chorus let's kick into _super bridge_), where, in my best leithauser, i growl\n\n```\nthe american idyll\nour whims are our bibles\nwe're searching the sidewalk\nfor chalk to inscribe 'em\n```\n\nto be clear, it doesn't really have any substance but i think the [multis](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Multi) are nice and sidewalk chalk is not a bad analog of my artistic and intellectual depth at the time. something i remember actually saying in my early twenties when it seemed to people like me who were not really informed about the world but thought that we were all riding skyward on the obama hope and change bus to the end of history was \"_the second bush administration was the happiest time in my life_\" which was both literally true (it was when i was in college after being completely isolated and depressed in high school) and disgustingly glib in how it reflected my ability to distance myself from all the awful things that (i knew) we did and had done and would continue to do. america is a trash country and has been since this land was stolen and i'll be ashamed of it forever (while i only have to be ashamed of the lyric \"_grab up all your passion_\" for another ten or fifteen years).\n\n![IMG_4550.jpg](/letters/images/42.jpg)",
