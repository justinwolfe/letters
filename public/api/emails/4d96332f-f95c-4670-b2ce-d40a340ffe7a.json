  "body": "i'm thankful that we got a lot of things unpacked yesterday. i'm thankful that we got shower curtains and i'm thankful for the process of punching out the ring holes in the shower curtain and pushing the rings through them. i'm thankful that we just use a clear plastic liner rather than a full opaque shower curtain, which i have never really understood the appeal of. i'm thankful it's now possible to walk through the kitchen and all the important basic utensils and containers there are unpacked. i'm thankful our new couch arrived and it is very comfortable. i'm thankful that though the internet still isn't working, despite d's having been on the phone with them multiple times since this weekend, she can go in to the office today and i have a mifi from work that should keep me suitably online until the comcast tech comes this afternoon and hopefully gets our actual internet working. i'm thankful after all of the fast food and junk we've been eating that i made us salads for dinner last night; i'm thankful to have used the fancy little jar of chili anchovies that my parents gave us as a gift at some point and that had just been sitting in the pantry. i'm thankful for [this amazing (and definitely NSFW!) video clip](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/right-in-front-of-my-salad?utm_term=.nlEVYJDKq#.kxjQEL2z3) of a woman eating salad while on the other side of the kitchen counter two men are having sex.\n\ni'm thankful for podcasts, which make unpacking much more pleasant. i'm thankful to have listened in on [the _glowing up_ podcast](http://www.feralaudio.com/show/glowing-up/) that d was listening to in her office and to have heard esther describe when she took baths as a child how her mom would sit in the bathroom with her talking on the phone to a friend and how for little esther that was like a proto-podcast (i'm thankful also for esther's recent podcasts with [her partner](http://www.feralaudio.com/126-dave-king/) and with [joe mande](http://www.feralaudio.com/128-joe-mande/)). i'm thankful while googling for links to those i came upon [this _new yorker_ post](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/esther-perel-lets-us-listen-in-on-couples-secrets) about a podcast that sounds fascinating. i'm thankful for a new conversation between [ezra klein and yascha mounk](https://art19.com/shows/the-ezra-klein-show/episodes/9100eb1c-93bd-4c78-8f18-48395630716e). i'm thankful to have learned from [this podcast](https://art19.com/shows/house-of-carbs/episodes/f5125fd8-676b-42b3-b3ce-f360b1aedca5) that the mara sisters had, until recently, [never eaten pie](http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/rooney-mara-never-tried-pie-until-last-year.html). i'm thankful to have eaten many pies in my life.\n\ni'm thankful for the netflix show _japan style originator_, which feels like peak slow tv. i'm thankful for the opening of the episode, which follows an adorable shiba inu running across a small japanese town to a sweet shop tended by a kind old lady. i'm thankful that the intro (which is the same for every episode) cuts away to macro-focused super slow motion food-porn shots of a japanese sweet being made, before returning to the old lady, who exits the shop and tucks the treat into a bandana wrapped around the dog's neck so that he can take it home. i'm thankful for d's delight at watching the current season of _masterchef_ on her phone (and am thankful that i don't have to wtach it). i'm thankful that we were talking about the padding and repetition in _masterchef_ and d said she wished that video players had the 10/15 second skip that podcasts have and i'm thankful to have said that i would also like for life to have that, before realizing that that's what looking at my phone and at twitter kind of is, this button i press that holds my consciousness in a close embrace that i then emerge from at a time that is seconds or minutes into the future, though it feels like no time has passed at all. i'm thankful for this strangely beautiful video of [men dancing to music they can't hear](https://twitter.com/MartiinZac/status/892171076687589377).",
