instead of being unergonomically hunched over a laptop using a mini travel mouse to [painstakingly erase the edges around a scan of an object](http://firmuhment-blog.tumblr.com/post/5455004423), i was able to work relaxed and reclined on my ipad, using the apple pencil to work through the contours smoothly, using two fingers to pan and zoom. i'm thankful [for what chalk looks like under a microscope](https://twitter.com/ferrisjabr/status/1022534132415356928). i'm thankful for [the latest in the videos of big boi training his pet owl hootie](https://twitter.com/natalieweiner/status/1022325450276831232). i'm thankful that we watched _a quiet place_ last night, even though that movie was pretty stupid, since it was fun for us to talk over it.\n\ni'm thankful for the song \"[trader joe](https://open.spotify.com/track/68UwqWt98BW1QdDnGV9DO1?si=UDXPC_kiQTqZytygh2HPrg)\" by junglepussy, which is so strummingly summery. i'm thankful for [the new tony molina album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7EPHzkk2dzoZpjHR8PB1ZY), which if you like to be guided by voices softly is something you will like (i'm thankful still for his album [dissed and dismissed](https://open.spotify.com/album/6zmGy8l0Xz4Snqn00zLSQq), which is power pop prose poems). i'm thankful for the tight production of \"[small foreign faction](https://open.spotify.com/track/6gEMNmqOAzvUM66JRFcds9)\" by haley blais and for the vapor trails of the feedback solo at the end. i'm thankful for the vocals in the chorus of \"[i don't blame you](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/1023030596958912517)\" by cat power. i'm thankful, when i played it in the car yesterday, to have learned when i'm out of town, d uses the song \"[i don't want to live forever](https://open.spotify.com/track/6yIdwnpDHufLWgQcveTPMk?autoplay=true&v=T)\" by zayn and taylor swift as her alarm clock, which i found very cute. i'm thankful that i am not out of town now, but we can still listen to that song and sing it together, since it is very fun to sing. i'm thankful for the joy of clumsy falsetto sung in the car with someone you love.",
