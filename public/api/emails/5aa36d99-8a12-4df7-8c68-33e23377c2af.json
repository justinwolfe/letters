I'm thankful for Life.\n\nI've always been a type A personality, but as I'm aging, I want life to slow down so I can absorb all that's going on around me, love the people in my life more, give them more of my time and attention. And spend more time enjoying what's around me, and already in my Life.\n\nLate June 2016 I was out for a walk with our dog Diesel, and my husband came with us, which he never does. And I stopped suddenly and told my husband I didn't feel right, and asked him to go get the car. Before he could turn away I fell to the ground on a neighbors lawn. Another neighbor called 911 and my husband did CPR.\n\nA little back story, my husband only 2 years before this was ill, it appeared he had Alzheimer's, he disappeared within himself, and was not the person he'd been. He wouldn't leave the house, didn't socialize, couldn't work, didn't know how to do all that he'd done for 50+ years of his life, he laid in bed all day while I was gone to work, then stared at the TV in the evening without caring what was on.\n\nAnd then...slowly, he came out of it, he's still not all that he was, and still can't work, doctors have no explanation for what happened, or what was wrong with him. But he came back to me, to Life, and being a happy person again.\n\nSo you can see, how if he'd still been sick, he wouldn't have been there to give me CPR.\n\nI ended up with a defibrillator before I could leave the hospital.\n\nI'm thankful for my husband and thankful for Life.\n\n\\- Sherry (10/10/2016). 56 years old, work in Human Resources, living with my husband of 6 years, our cat Snap and our dog Diesel",
