  "body": "I’m thankful that today I made a website for myself, something that I’ve been meaning to do for a year now. I’m thankful that even though it really wasn’t that challenging it still felt like I was pushing myself since I am not particularly technologically adept. I’m thankful I figured out how to change the font (in the code!) to Futura, which is my favorite. I’m thankful that I was able to use the sketch that Louise drew of me, which I feel captures me well, for the “about me” page. I’m thankful that I had the idea to include some deep cuts in my clips, and that in the process of scanning and uploading my juvenilia I got to read it and laugh at it. I’m thankful that I seem to have emerged from the womb with the sensibilities that I have today, even though my therapist thinks my “people don’t change” worldview discounts the progress I have made. I’m thankful for my dark sense of humor and my love of grocery shopping.\n\nI’m thankful for being able to solve a math problem this evening and for laughing about it with my parents, because lately I haven’t been getting along well with them.\n\nI’m thankful that Teddy messaged me to tell me that he had received my letter and read it to his roommate. I’m thankful that his roommate, an overeager Dutch teenager, friended me on facebook. I’m thankful that Teddy has told him about me because it makes me feel cared for and important to his life. I am thankful that he ended our conversation by saying sleep tight even though it was only 6 pm here. I’m thankful to think of him in a computer room in Italy with Noah, looking over each others’ shoulders at their respective computer screens, because I know that scene exactly and can imagine it perfectly even though I am not there, which is a comfort because it is nice to have something familiar to hold on to while we are so far apart.\n\n\\-Chloe",
