  "body": "i'm thankful that the movers we hired were friendly, strong, and incredibly fast. i'm thankful that they got our stuff moved out of the old house, loaded onto a truck, across town, and then moved into the new house in a little over two hours. i'm thankful to have given them each good tips. i'm thankful that we got all of our vital utilities transferred over. i'm thankful for the many quasi-legal runs we made to the dumpsters of apartment complexes around town to dump excess trash. i'm thankful that this made me afraid, especially when a cop in a pickup truck pulled right alongside us while we were doing it, but i'm thankful that it had to be done and we got it done. i'm thankful that we ate pizza over the box while sitting on the floor last night. i'm thankful that the air conditioning in this house works very well. i'm thankful that our new couch, which we have been waiting on for months, is coming today. i'm thankful that though our internet isn't working, it's probably just a bad coaxial cable and we're going to go to get a new one soon. i'm thankful to have washed our bedding so that our first night in the new house could be in a clean bed. i'm thankful that though we forgot to buy shower curtains, we showered as best as we could without them because it was vital to feel clean. i'm thankful that we ate ice cream in bed while browsing the internet aimlessly. i'm thankful that we both have the day off today to continue unpacking and to generally decelerate from the intensity of moving. i'm thankful that we are finally done with it and now get to start stepping into our new lives here.",
