  "body": "i'm thankful that i had another night of poor sleep last night. i'm thankful that last night, probably because too late yesterday evening i was doing some work related to the end of my current job, it was an anxiety dream about my new job, which in the dream was a writing job at MTV news, which in the dream was based in phoenix, arizona for some reason. i'm thankful to remember how uncool i felt at the job and how i was constantly struggling to find clothes to wear (which i think is a reflection of the fact that in the real world i need to do our laundry). i'm thankful there were other new people starting at the same time as me (as there will be at my real new job, which i'm thankful for) and they were also flailing and didn't fit in, though the solidarity of that wasn't as strong as it is in the real world. i'm thankful to remember a very weird part at the end of the dream where my new coworkers were tricked into drinking yellow water with essential oils in it out of a diffuser as a hazing ritual and i refused. i'm thankful that in the dream it was very difficult to ride my bike, which is not true in real life. i'm thankful that things in life are rarely as difficult as they are in anxiety dreams and i'm thankful in waking life to be very excited about my new job and to only have one more week at my current job. i'm thankful that tonight i will be more careful about my sleep hygiene so that i can catch up on sleep debt (i'm thankful for the horrible concept of sleep debt, which is an example of the incursion of the economic sphere into every area of life).\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday evening we watched _american ultra_, the semi-comedic action movie starring jesse eisenberg and kristen stewart. i'm thankful that though the movie wasn't perfect, it was very diverting and funny. i'm thankful to like both of these actors and to believe that they both gave some of their best performances here. i'm thankful also for connie britton (i'm thankful for [this amazing photo of she and kristen gillibrand as roommates](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/18/connie-britton-kirsten-gillibrand-throwback-photo_n_5844510.html)) and topher grace (who should always play an asshole) and john leguizamo and the guy who played buster on arrested development (i'm thankful to recognize he is named tony hale and should be addressed as such, since it must be very annoying to always be called the name of one character you played)(i'm thankful to know we really need to watch _veep_ at some point)(i'm thankful we are still watching _crashing_, which is still very uproariously funny but has become more and more sad at the same time—i'm thankful for how good phoebe waller-bridge is at walking that particular tightrope)\n\ni'm thankful for [this really cool interactive essay about j dilla's \"don't cry\"](http://tinysubversions.com/essays/dontcry/) (i'm thankful for its demonstration of how difficult it is to make

my professor gently pointed this out but said that from the writing in the rest of my essay it was clearly just an accident rather than me trying to get away. i'm thankful to remember that book makes some argument about walter benjamin and the notion of the aura re: \"stairway to heaven\" that i found very powerful (i'm thankful to have found things about walter benjamin very powerful in college, like when i was taking a class on byzantine art and i learned about the status of the copy in icon painting (where icons represent a direct connection to the divine, _are_ the divine, rather than just representations of it) and wrote an essay talking about walter benjamin and i'm thankful when she handed our papers back the professor sarcastically said \"_a lot of you are very interested in walter

Klee drawing named “Angelus Novus” shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating.  His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread.  This is how one pictures the angel of history.  His face is turned toward the past.  Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe that keeps piling ruin upon ruin and hurls it in front of his feet.  The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed.  But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them.  The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.
