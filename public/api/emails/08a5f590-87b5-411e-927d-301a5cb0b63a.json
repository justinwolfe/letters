  "body": "I'm thankful for turning 31. I'm thankful that my birthday falls on the first of the month and that it divides the year in half. I'm thankful that yesterday always feels like a true new year's eve and today always feels like a new beginning.\n\nI'm thankful that the bartender last night made us complimentary [French 75](https://food52.com/blog/10808-the-french-75)s after I had already had 2 glasses of prosecco because we mentioned we were waiting until midnight to celebrate.\n\nI'm thankful that I don't have a hangover today and that we've rented a car to go to Dia:Beacon today and that I won't be in the city and that I told work I'm completely unavailable. I'm thankful for those enormous luxuries.\n\nI'm thankful for the luxury of the bag of Cape Cod Waffle Cut Potato Chips and the 2 bottles of Perrier-Jouet Champagne waiting for tonight. I've never been much for sweet things and this is my favorite, if not completely Bougie tradition I've cultivated. I never have cake or dessert on my birthday. I just have a bottle of champagne and a whole bag of potato chips.\n\nI'm thankful that I'm incredibly hard on myself leading up today, that I always feel like I haven't done enough in the last year to earn moving on to the next one. I'm thankful that these notes have reminded me to not only be thankful for the tiny and the enormous but also created a space where I write more than I have in years. Where I think I'm a little gentler on myself and that is a tiny, enormous thing.\n\nI'm thankful for the small and for the large things and thankful for halves and wholes and for kindnesses and loss. I'm thankful that I have another year with which to try, and try harder. I'm thankful for that gift. Oh! And for the voicemail my aunt leaves me every year at like 7:30am singing me Happy Birthday! \n\n\\- Esmé (7/1/16). most internet spaces: esmeawright\n\npreviously: [1](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm), [2](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-2), [3](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-3), [4](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-4), [5](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-5), [6](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/tyn-esm), [7](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/tyn-esm-7)",
