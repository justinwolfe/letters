  "body": "i'm thankful that as i was about to sit down at my computer and either write you or (probably more likely) go ahead and start my work day, i saw that miso was waiting on the back patio to come in through the sliding glass door of my office and i'm thankful that when i went to let her in, i noticed that she had the tennis ball we keep in the yard in her mouth and i'm thankful that though i was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt and not dressed warmly enough to go outside, i took the tennis ball and threw it through the open door out to the yard, where she enthusiastically retrieved it. i'm thankful to have done this a few more times and, her attention not flagging, to have said fuck it and put on a hoodie and gone outside properly. i'm thankful that this morning it's sunny and not particularly cold and i'm thankful that miso and i played fetch at a different angle (facing the stand of trees at the back edge of the yard from the house, vs. standing in the middle of the yard and bouncing the ball off the garage to the left of the yard) and she seemed to enjoy it and we played longer than i think we ever have before.",
