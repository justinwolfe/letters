  "body": "i'm thankful that my doctor appointment went well. i'm thankful that even though my blood pressure was high, my doctor was not concerned and did not see a need for further intervention at this time. i am thankful that she prescribed a sleep aid, as i had requested. i'm thankful that though the sleep aid did not really aid sleep and, additionally, had the unexpected and extremely uncomfortable side effect of a multi-hour erection which would not go away even as i thought of the unsexiest thoughts, my equipment is fine, if a bit sore, this morning, unlike the equipment of my fellow human being whose case is described in the medical journal paper which is the first google result for \"[trazodone erection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910996/),\" which i googled at 3am when the erection would still not go away. i'm thankful i did not read further than the title and the first paragraph. i'm thankful that i no longer have an erection now but i'm thankful for all the erections that i will have in the future.\n\ni'm thankful for the nice old woman named edna at the doctor's office, who looked lost and uncomfortable and who was so reassured when i told that her son was in the bathroom and would probably be out soon. i'm thankful that i'm a more social person than i was in the past, when i probably would have looked down at my phone and not say anything. i'm thankful for her perm and her round glasses and kind smile and peachcolored sweatsuit.\n\ni'm thankful that an employer i am excited about wants to move forward with the interview process. i'm thankful for the possibility of a new kind of work and a new kind of work life and maybe even, because the position is remote, a new kind of life, depending on what d and i want to do. i'm thankful i am not getting my hopes up too much, but i'm also thankful that i'm excited.\n\ni'm thankful for kombucha and matcha and yoga, which kept me awake today, pushing back against the torpor caused by the sleep aid / having a multi-hour erection.\n\ni'm thankful that my bank quickly and easily replaced my lost credit card.\n\ni'm thankful for [analyze phish](http://www.earwolf.com/show/analyze-phish/). i'm thankful that even though harris wittels is dead, i can still listen to him over and over on podcasts and that they still make me smile and laugh. i'm thankful for podcasts in general, which fill what otherwise might be periods of drudgery with joy. i'm thankful for [chelsea peretti](http://www.feralaudio.com/show/call-chelsea-peretti/), who is the funniest person on earth. i'm thankful for that one time she retweeted d's cartoon of her, which means that she has a minute thread of a connection to us which only enhances the feeling of intimacy engendered by listening to her voice for hundreds of hours.\n\ni'm thankful for the rain suit that d got me, which i wore for the first time today. i'm thankful for the military-industrial bulk of it, which made me feel like i was wearing the power armor from fallout 4. i'm thankful that it mostly kept me dry, and i'm thankful that rain got on my face, because now i know i still should carry a small umbrella with it.\n\ni'm thankful that president obama reads [game of thrones recaps](https://www.vulture.com/2015/11/barack-obama-almost-certainly-reads-got-recaps.html).",
