I've checked this with my specialist and convinced him. I'm happy to inform you that I'll replace the device as one time exception for you and I also help you with the free next day shipping. so that you can get the device very soon.\"\\_\n\ni'm thankful they had some good news to deliver me (for their sake and mine). i'm thankful that good customer service is not just about the words used, but in the actions they represent. i'm thankful my new phone is scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. i'm thankful to be receiving a new phone for free, since mine is in pretty bad shape from dropping it countless times without a case on it. i'm thankful for fresh starts and the promise they hold, even when they feel unwanted and ill-timed. i'm thankful for shiny new gadgets.\n\ni'm thankful to be home after a fun but exhausting week away. i'm thankful to feel unsure of how i'll wake up tomorrow morning without a working phone to set an alarm on. i'm thankful i'm about to go to sleep in my own bed.\n\n\\- e (8/14/17).\n\n[what are you thankful for?](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
