i was a brat used to getting my own way) edits were just about making me fit into the box of the magazine rather than making my piece the best it could be.\n\ni'm thankful that when i finally wrote something that i thought was really good, i emailed choire to ask if he might publish it on the awl, a ridiculous pitch email that ended, after a bulleted list of descriptions of the limitations of the essay and of myself as a writer, with the paragraph \"_Listing the potential problems with a piece being in a particular publication is probably not the way you are supposed to pitch things to editors of publications, right?  Well, FINE.  If it doesn't work for you for the aforementioned reasons or any other ones (I'm sure there are other ones!), no problem, I'll just blog it on my blog, but I'm getting bored with scanning 10,000 word essays and I've always wanted to have something on the Awl so I thought I'd see if you wanted it first._\"  \n\ni'm thankful that he took it immediately and that over the next few months pushed me into revising it in ways that made it better than i could have made it myself, all the while supporting me and never making me feel like i had to accept something just because he said so. i'm thankful for how proud i was when the essay was published, how i felt like it was the best thing i had ever written and it was published at my favorite place on the internet. i'm thankful for e, who emailed me from new york to tell me how she had been at a coffee shop and overheard people (STRANGERS) discussing it. i'm thankful i was in my mfa program at the time and one day soon after i came into my pedagogy class, which we shared with the literature phd students, and this girl i vaguely knew told me that she'd seen it in the awl and had passed it around to some other people. i'm thankful that later i emailed choire something else to see if he'd publish it and he wrote back:\n\n\"_OH I THINK I DO?_\n\n_it's not normally a thing we would do! which makes it even more fun!_\n\n_IN FACT i have a strange spot today--we do this sort of WEIRD THING at_\n\n_the end of the day friday to stay up all weekend and scare people and_\n\n_maybe we should do this for that???_\"\n\ni'm thankful that this is what the awl was to me, a place where doing a thing they wouldn't normally do wasn't a problem but was even more fun, where they would put a WEIRD THING up at the end of the day friday to stay up all weekend and scare people. i'm thankful for everything that it gave me and everyone else, for what it gave the culture, and i'm thankful that even if it's going to go away, there are so many people who were touched by its influence that are writing today and will continue to write and that some fragment of it is in all of us and will never really go away. i'm thankful that at the end of 2009, its first year, i was writing descriptions of websites i'd read that year as food and i described the awl as \"_a pretty good sandwich served on an ugly plate by someone who loves you_.\" i'm thankful for the love, which i'll never forget.",
