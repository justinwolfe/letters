or just LYING\" radar, because [the book is so wonderful](http://www.amazon.com/Folded-Clock-Diary-Heidi-Julavits/dp/0804171440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460554993&sr=8-1&keywords=the+folded+clock). i'm thankful that d got me this harness that she learned about from her chiropractor which is like a resistance band you wear and is supposed to help you remember to pull your shoulders back rather than hunching forward. i'm thankful that of course it made me think of the [bro/manziere](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bro+seinfeld) (i'm thankful that i prefer \"manziere\" and have always been disappointed that \"snuggy\" became the term rather than \"slanket,\" which i think is a much more fun word to say).\n\ni'm thankful to have learned that & other stories, which i knew [as a euro clothing brand](http://www.stories.com/us/) from [british fashion vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTjb1i9w3WI) (i'm thankful, because i hate short stories, that they own the domain name \"[stories.com](http://stories.com)\"!), is also [the name of a respected literary publisher](http://www.andotherstories.org/). i'm thankful for this [plan for foreign intervention](https://twitter.com/PAPPADEMAS/status/720050747514032128). i'm thankful, since i recently bought the nicest and most expensive kindle, that amazon is releasing [a nicer and more expensive kindle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00REQKWGA/ref=ods_gw_d_h1_eink_os_beach?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-hero-kindle-A&pf_rd_r=0Y9EE59W61CYJZ3ACRXR&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2467268422&pf_rd_i=desktop), which i will probably buy eventually because i want to accelerate the end of the world. i'm thankful for [this cake](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/raspberry-ricotta-cake) d made for dessert this week, which is always great and always reminds me weirdly of cornbread despite not having cornmeal in it and is the perfect cake for the way that it is very satisfying and well-rounded without being too rich or sweet or fatty-feeling. i'm thankful for the friendly ghost-ness of [this vine of face swapping while vaping](http://imgur.com/jUSRvv9), which i could watch forever.",
