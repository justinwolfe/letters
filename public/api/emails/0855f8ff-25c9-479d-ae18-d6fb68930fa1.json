it's hard to even begin to conceptualize the shape that change would take.  For so many reasons it seems like a dumb idea to try to be a writer today and no way to make a living and \"writer\" does not describe every aspect of my life or who I am but it is the best-fit identity I have been able to find and so I keep trying to find new, slightly different ways to make it fit when I come undone, just the same way that Julia Allison keeps dating guys and then making representations of those dates and her life that make everybody (people on the Internet, television audiences, the guys, herself) hate her and experiencing the force of this hatred and then trying to make a change in her life which, seemingly inevitably, given the skills and life and worldview she has to work with (however they might have minutely evolved in response to disappointment in her life) means making even more representations of dates and her life and etc..._\n\n_That's why I can't hate Julia Allison because I feel like Julia Allison is fucking up her life the same way I am fucking up my life and, I think, a lot of us are fucking up our lives, because we don't really know what else we can do and we want to do something so we keep repeating, with slight variations, these patterns that we've carved out, knowing that the patterns are problematic and maybe not the best things for us, in the hope that some iteration or other of them is going to finally click, be the right one that get us to the place that we want to be.  Which is probably a dumb thing to believe in, but believing in the promise of a better life in the future is in general, kind of a dumb thing, given the evidence to the contrary that the world gives us every day, but God, fuck the alternative, I will take Julia Allison's fake dumb ugly hope any day over not believing._\n\ni'm thankful that though some things stay the same, some things also change. i'm thankful that though i don't think of myself as a writer anymore, at least not in the way i did back then, i also don't have the same kind of stress and baggage about my writing that i had back then, that while writing a newsletter every day back then felt like a constant struggle that i had to force myself in to to \"succeed\", today it feels much less hard and like it's something i'm doing because i know it always makes me feel better to do it (and i think makes other people feel better sometimes too). i'm thankful that i have found some patterns for myself that click, even if i'm still working on others. \n\ni'm thankful for julio cortázar's [instructions on how to sing](https://twitter.com/lilghosthands/status/943625657178836993). i'm thankful for [these pictures of toni morrison at a disco in new york in 1974](https://twitter.com/joshywinty/status/943742389948002304). i'm thankful for [this joke about david foster wallace and water](https://twitter.com/kellyconaboy/status/943641206231269377) and [this joke about colin firth and water](https://twitter.com/TriciaLockwood/status/943667651036971008) and [this one about guillermo del toro and water](https://twitter.com/kumailn/status/942845516265562112) and in general for [the transformations that water makes possible](https://twitter.com/fairdefeat/status/943560069983092736). i'm thankful [to wait for the magic](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uK1agHAnOsyCo62SBEO5y).",
