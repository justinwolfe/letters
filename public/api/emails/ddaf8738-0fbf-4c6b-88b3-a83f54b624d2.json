I'm thankful most of my clothes were clean and I could chose what to wear. I'm thankful that even if I felt anxious coming out of the house in the afternoon I saw the old lady from the first floor reading a book with a detectivesque magnifying glass sitting on the stairs, under the sun. I'm thankful a neighbour just walked past and called her name and now I know her name is May. I'm thankful today in the library while talking to my parents my mother sent me a picture of our summer house and I remembered my grandmother's face. I'm thankful today when I arrived home my flatmate was in the kitchen singing to spanish music and didn't stop. I'm thankful she asked me to tell her which were our toothbrushes and I told her we only had one for now and she just smiled. \n\n\\- silvia (8/2/17).\n[what are you thankful for?](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true)",
