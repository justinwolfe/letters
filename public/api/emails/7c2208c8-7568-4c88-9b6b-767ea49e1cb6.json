  "body": "i'm thankful i'm on vacation. i'm thankful that i fell asleep early last night, not out of exhaustion, but out of warmth and comfort and relaxation. i'm thankful that when i woke up at 11:30 and realized what had happened, i wasn't mad that i missed out on time doing things, because i've still got plenty of time. i'm thankful for the new book i started reading last night, [_no harm can come to a good man_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZY3HSEE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) by james smythe. i'm thankful that even though the book isn't fantastic yet, it's very readable and has mystery and promise that impel me forward. i'm thankful for [_the machine_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QU6V94/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), which is my favorite novel by this author so far.\n\ni'm thankful that even though this [mapo tofu](http://food52.com/recipes/28917-fuschsia-dunlop-s-ma-po-tofu) turned out way too salty and had too much sichuan pepper, it was still (barely) edible. i'm thankful that we are privileged enough to be able to throw out the leftovers rather than force ourselves to eat them again and i'm thankful that we have the ingredients to try a new batch with a tweaked recipe. i'm thankful d found the sichuan peppercorns at the international market. i'm thankful for the totally bizarre sensation i experienced while eating one whole. i'm thankful for our trip to the grocery store yesterday, where we bought lots of delicious food to eat. i'm thankful to eat charcuterie and fruit and baguette tonight.\n\ni'm thankful for [redacted].\n\ni'm thankful for the wrinkly skin on the underside of my yoga mat, which, as i roll it, still blissed out from meditation, reminds me of human skin. i'm thankful for getting back into meditation, which i had lost touch with for a moment. i'm thankful for the time to meditate more later.\n\ni'm thankful for the tiramisu d made for my birthday. i'm thankful that ladyfingers were on sale and that the recipe makes a huge tray, which allows for lots of healthy portions. i'm thankful that we are taking a vacation break from our dessert fast, and i'm thankful that she's going to make a pumpkin pie after we finish the tiramisu. i'm thankful that, aside from pumpkin pie, we don't have to eat any of the traditional thanksgiving food that i hate, and i'm thankful that the food we do have will not require much effort, leaving lots of time for relaxing.\n\ni'm thankful for the run i had yesterday. i'm thankful that though it was the coldest day of the year so far, i felt fine in my gloves and tights and down coat. i'm thankful for the rush of endorphins to my brain and for the feeling of power and freedom i experience as i cover great tracts of land. i'm thankful that i didn't experience any of the unpleasant side effects i've experienced after long runs in the past.\n\ni'm thankful i tried mixing gin with my kombucha, which turned out to taste much better than i had expected.\n\ni'm thankful for the amazon adaptation of _the man in the high castle_, which has been much more entertaining than the book version was on the occasions in the past when i tried and failed to read it. i'm thankful that even if it isn't the greatest tv show ever, it's solidly entertaining and has an intriguing plot and world. i'm thankful for _wayward pines_, which seems kind of analogous in terms of style and shape and cheap junk food bliss point, and i'm thankful that the acting and writing on this are much better than that show.\n\ni'm thankful that after steeping this tea for the third time, i can still taste an outline of the flavor.",
