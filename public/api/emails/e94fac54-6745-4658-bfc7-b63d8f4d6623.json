  "body": "i'm thankful i had my practice transfer viva today. i'm thankful my colleagues and i call it a mini viva. i'm thankful to realise that some of the fear i felt towards my supervisor have faded. i'm thankful to have been practising power poses in the elevator on my way to her office. i'm thankful i didn't notice it had stopped until a guy walked in. i'm thankful to have hoped he didn't see me being silly. i'm thankful that the way he winked at me when i got off let me know he saw me. i'm thankful for how exasperated my supervisor was at me because i couldn't answer a lot of her questions. i'm thankful for how angry i was at myself about not answering the questions right. i'm thankful to have realised she was getting frustrated because she thought my big viva was this afternoon. i'm thankful for her obvious relief when she found out it was next week. i'm thankful that despite not being able to answer all the questions, i got some good pointers on what to research before the viva. \n\ni'm thankful for j, my friend who i talk about a lot. i'm thankful we met up on tuesday to talk about a church project we'll be working on from september. i'm thankful for how easily we work together. i'm thankful he suggested nando's for dinner because he knows it's my favorite and i have a loyalty card. i'm thankful we ordered a full chicken to share because we were really hungry. i'm thankful i reminded him to order the least spicy thing on the menu. i'm thankful he tried to play it off. i'm thankful i got him the hottest sauce for his chips and watched his face go red as he ate. i'm thankful we talked about the practical aspects of the project. i'm thankful we've been planning the project for about a year now. i'm thankful i stopped talking about the project a couple of months ago because i thought he was not interested in it anymore. i'm thankful he asked if i still wanted to do the project. i'm thankful to have said yes. i'm thankful that even though we are very excited about it it will take a lot of work and a lot of difficult conversations. i'm thankful one particular conversation will be really hard as it means we'll be leaving some of our dearest friends behind. i'm thankful to hope the conversation goes well and we can stay in contact with our friends. i'm thankful to remember the time when e, my friend told me i couldn't be friends with guys without falling in love with them. i'm thankful to prove him wrong.\n\ni'm thankful for my graduation from leadership college last week. i'm thankful i took the day off and spent sometime preparing myself both physically and mentally for an evening of smiling and having conversation. i'm thankful for the lace top i ordered in a frenzy and wasn't sure it'd look good. i'm thankful it did look good paired with my polka dot full skirt. i'm thankful that skirt makes me happy and reminds me of sound of music. i'm thankful to have worn make-up for the first time this year. i'm thankful to have worn contacts and left my glasses behind even though contacts gross me out. i'm thankful for how different i felt to be dressed that way instead of my daily uniform of tee shirts and jeans. i'm thankful to reinforce the stereotype of both scientists and PhD students in the way i dress. i'm thankful for k, l and v who came along with me and had fun eating all the canapes and taking inappropiate photos in the photobooth. i'm thankful that j (another one) who i really like was ordained as a reverend a couple of weeks ago. i'm thankful to have walked up to him and congratulated him. i'm thankful he turned around and complimented me, saying how good i looked and how great my fashion sense is. i'm thankful to have started naming our future kids. i'm thankful when j (friend) asked what i was going to do about my crush i said nothing. i'm thankful there really is nothing i can do about it as he's neither on facebook or twitter. i'm thankful to ignore the fact that i could actually just physically talk to him. i'm thankful to realise i have about 6 js in my life. \n\ni'm thankful i got free tickets to 'the play that goes wrong' yesterday. i'm thankful for l, my flatmate who called and offered me the ticket. i'm thankful to have seen it with e, j (another one) and l. i'm thankful for how hard we laughed. i'm thankful it was a nice thing in the midst of the craziness of my life and the world. i'm thankful for new meds. i'm thankful to not think about brexit, black lives matter, our new prime minister and the labor party and how everything is bent on self-destructing. i'm thankful to be going to l's baby shower on saturday. i'm thankful to hope she really enjoys hte pamper set i got her.\n\ni'm thankful for how i've become the office pop culture correspondent. i'm thankful for how much joy it brings me to tell people about my reflections on pop culture. i'm thankful that lunch time has become a time when i introduce my colleagues to something the cool kids say or do. i'm thankful to have convinced a couple of them to sign up to twitter and recommended a couple of people for them to follow. i'm thankful to not recommend my handle to them because my twitter is a different world and a different aspect of me i don't want them to experience. i'm thankful for the hour i spent describing the kardashian empire to them today. i'm thankful for f who always asks me to go to really cool documentaries of films the school of media studies puts on. i'm thankful we're going to one about polyamory next week. i'm thankful i get to work with some of the most intelligent but also fun people. \n\n\\- moe 7/14/16.
