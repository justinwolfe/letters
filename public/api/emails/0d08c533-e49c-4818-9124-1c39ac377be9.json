  "body": "i'm thankful for a four day weekend, which is such a transporting phenomenon, this sense of distance from work, of inner peace. i'm thankful that though i got the sunday scaries yesterday off schedule, even though it wasn't sunday, i actually don't feel them as badly as usual right now. i'm thankful that d made my updated resume look really nice. i'm thankful i worked on my hobby project some and got a really cool touch interaction working.\n\ni'm thankful for thanksgiving at ec's house. i'm thankful that though i don't really like thanksgiving food, there were lots of delicious things and i stuffed myself. i'm thankful that people liked the brussels sprouts with nam pla i brought. i'm thankful that though we forgot to bring our folding chair, everyone just ended up standing around the kitchen island grazing, which i think is the ideal. i'm thankful that there were two desserts (pumpkin pie and a cheesecake-y tart) and i had two servings of each.\n\ni'm thankful that we have found a pizza place that we really like here, that makes these enormous heavily sauced very salty hawaiians. i'm thankful for roastaroma tea, which as someone who doesn't have caffeine is the closest i can get with milk and sugar to the experience as possible and which i have taken to brewing in giant mason jars that i wrap with a thick purple sock as a koozie. i'm thankful also for ice water, for variety in beverages. i'm thankful that though the pho place we tried to go for lunch yesterday was closed, there was a ramen place nearby, and though it was also pretty mediocre ramen, it was hot soup on a cold day, which is almost always something to be thankful for.\n\ni'm thankful for the comic book of _watchmen_, which i started reading because the show is so good and which is also good. i'm thankful that d and i have been playing _terraria_ together on our switches; i'm thankful to get to share a game with her, since normally we don't play well together. i'm thankful that she crafts items for me to use, since she enjoys the crafting and management aspects of the game, and i'm thankful to deposit my various metal bars with her. i'm thankful for the sword she gave me, which is so much better than the sword i was using.\n\ni'm thankful that while we were at the grocery store, running separate missions through the produce section, i looked out the glass doors and high windows in the front of the store and saw that it was snowing.",
