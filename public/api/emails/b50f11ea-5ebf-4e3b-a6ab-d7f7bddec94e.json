That’s how I know there’s more in the world than me.\" \n\ni'm thankful that d and i played more terraria together and that she's been playing in her own world and crafted herself a silver helmet.\n\ni'm thankful for the deep flow state of reading, even though when i do it at night, i often fall asleep more quickly than i'd like to, since a) in the past i've had much more trouble falling asleep and so more sleep is better than less and b) the fact that i'm falling asleep means that the volume of the notification system in my brain has been turned down enough to make that possible.\n\ni'm thankful for that paul rudd show on netflix, which i had only experienced in meme form until we watched the first couple of episodes last night. i'm thankful for high concept premises and i'm thankful for paul rudd.\n\ni'm thankful there was some good news waiting for me in my inbox when i woke up this morning.",
