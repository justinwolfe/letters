I understand that we're coming to this work with different standards and I'm trying to learn from you and meet yours as best as I can but seeing 😬 😬 😬 all the time is kind of demoralizing. Thank you for your consideration ❤️)\n\nand i'm thankful, since it was stressful to send 😅, that she is in the same time zone as me and even though it was almost the end of the workday on friday responded almost immediately (using the facepalm emoji 🤦‍♀️) to sincerely apologize and also to clarify that she was not intending for the grimace emojis to be read as critical of me but instead the opposite 💡, that she meant them to read as an apologetic smile trying to acknowledge to me that she knew she was making very picky and sometimes out of scope notes that were leading to a lot of extra maybe not necessary (but, in her mind, important enough to ask for, which even if i disagree with i can respect) work for me and she was sorry about that 😟. i'm thankful to have responded thanking her and telling her that i understood and then in our Slack DMs we wished each other a good weekend, which even though i don't really drink beer anymore i like to use the 🍻 emoji for.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/359.webp) \n\ni'm thankful that we saw _dune 2_ with our friends and that aside from the casting of christopher walken was exactly what i wanted from it. i'm thankful, given the world we are living in, for the often quite moving portrayals of anticolonial resistance. i'm thankful for denis villenueve's semi-formalist approach to cinema as dream and as spectacle. i'm thankful for zendaya and timmy and a hilarious performance by javier bardem. i'm thankful for ec's new sweatshirt that said \"WORLD PEACE\" and that she nudged me to buy a bag of trolli brite crawlers gummy worms as the most appropriate snack pairing for the movie (don't worry i was already high on the spice before entering the theater). i'm thankful that the coke freestyle machine has lime seltzer and to have repeatedly brought back the joke of saying \"denis villenueve\" in an exaggerated bad french accent.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/358.webp) \n\ni'm thankful i got so mad during the trailers for dune because there is a children's movie (🙄) starring ryan reynolds (🤮) that used \"all my friends\" by LCD soundsystem as its soundtrack (🤬🤬🤬) which should be against the fucking law. on that note, this week's playlist is not by me but is by deborah, who sent out [an issue of her own newsletter](https://buttondown.email/dire/archive/time-capsule/) about the wayback machine trip previously discussed [here](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/curtsying-and-lunging/) that included both diaries from when she was in eighth grade 🥹 and [a playlist of songs from her MP3 blog when she was 13](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J4VrG30BbSlzGAMiqKbfE?si=0d6b69fd425b41ab&utm_source=dire&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=time-capsule). i'm thankful as a person who has not ever really at any time in my life wanted to listen to \"sad music\" (when i am sad, i want to listen to happy music to make me feel better, and when i am happy, i want to listen to happy music because i am happy and want to continue feeling that way) to not know most of these songs and to get this window into who young deborah (a figure i possess unlimited tenderness towards) listened to. i'm thankful to be married to someone who cares about music as much as me, even if occasionally our tastes differ (my favorite new-to-me song on the playlist is [\"blue collar love\"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Roe5sWpYp5yWMfclCH9jk?si=bf58c1b2b7e54ee1) by starflyer 69, which has really excellent guitars).
