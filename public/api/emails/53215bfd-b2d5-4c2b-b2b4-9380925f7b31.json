She is always vocal about the love she has for me. F even shares things about the love I feel about her. The truth is, I always felt sorry for not having this ability to express myself about her. But that’s how I was brought up, and love is a tension so intense that speaks by itself.\nThe truth is, if there is a day where I am supposed to announce my love for you to all the world, F, that day is today. And so we present this little surprise, a classic among weddings.\nJust to give you some background: I feel like I need to tell you all that I am not insane. F IS insane, but since she assumes herself as an eccentric, no one has the guts to tell her she is insane!\nWe used to spend our days making impromptu musicals. I’ve always found improv musicals funny, but I am not good on desgarradas or hip hop. We always sing songs in improv because we don’t need to rhyme, it is enough to fit inside the melody and we can say the most foolish things that we want that it will always sound like a Disney-theme song.\nOur dog, B, is the protagonist of most of our songs - to his dismay! \nSome time ago, F and I started to make a song, and C happened to be there and what came of it was the song we’re about to sing.\nSince C is very sweet and had the original idea, she suggested that I could write a small text to accompany her while she sang.. And since I’ve always fancied myself to be a writer, I chose to accept the challenge, although this will pain me the most.\nMy dear F….\n\nIn silence I tell you that I love you\nSo that you can hear me\nI touch your hand…\nI kiss your forehead before I leave for work\nOr rise earlier to wake you up\nAs you hate\nOr to make you your favourite cup of coffee\nThat I don’t know why it’s your favourite\n\nWhen you speak to me,\nEverything you say is to love me.\nWhen you touch my hand,\nOr get up earlier, without waking me up\nWhen you laugh,\nWhen you look at me\nAnd see me for who I am\nWhat I am\nEven before I know it.\n\nWords mean to say,\nBut everything I can say about you you already know\nEveryone knows\nThat you are beautiful,\nLike I whisper in your ear,\nThat you are strong,\nThat you are different\nBut just like me\nThat somehow I’ve known you since forever\nSince before you were born\nSince before I was born\nEver since God.\n\nBut I don’t love you more for that,\nI don’t like you for what you are,\nI love you\nand love who you are\nYou, F. To you, MF\nYour baptism name\nLike you usually say.\nIt’s not because you treat me nicely,\nBecause you understand me,\nIt’s because I love you.\nI love you and want to love you,\nI ask God every day that tomorrow I can love you a bit more,\nA bit better,\nAsk Him that you love me more,\nBut not for the sake of loving me more,\nBut because Love creates more Love\nand it’s our will to love that brings us together,\nThat makes us grow,\nthat makes us Be\nF and J. \"\n\nI love you J.
