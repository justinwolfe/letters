floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhASu2OjEcQ)\" by hot chip which i had stuck in my head yesterday and \"[i'm not going to teach your boyfriend to dance with you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhASu2OjEcQ)\" which i have stuck in my head now. i'm thankful for a busy day at work but one with nice times with my coworkers. i'm thankful that we were talking about our parents' jobs and i linked to a [local TV promo that my dad gave me a starring role in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX7bB9KV2fY) when i was young, which my coworkers found diverting and funny. i'm thankful to be at a phase in my life where i find this entertaining and not embarrassing. \n\ni'm thankful that we facetimed my parents after dinner last night and i told them about that, which i think made them both happy. i'm thankful that they were happy to show off the new coffee table my dad built and how when spaghetti squash is roasted long enough you can pull it into noodles by raking a fork across it. i'm thankful that my dad forgot about the name of the [marcella hazan tomato sauce](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce) and texted me asking for the recipe. i'm thankful that it made them both happy when i showed them the bass amp that i bought with the money they gave me for christmas and were excited to learn that i've been playing music with others. i'm thankful that they reminded me that tomorrow is my brother's birthday so i didn't forget and i got him a gift certificate for the playstation store, since his hours got cut at work and he doesn't have a lot of disposable income.\n\ni'm thankful for my new bass amp, which is a fender rumble. i'm thankful for how loud and clear it sounds (unless i turn on the overdrive circuit, at which point it sounds loud and dirty). i'm thankful that if i turn on the horn, it also makes a pretty good guitar amp. i'm thankful for the physical sensation of a speaker pushing strong waves of sound at you, for the tiny rattles echoing around our bedroom when i turned up the master volume knob a bit. i'm thankful, even though i am tired from the exertions of the week, that i have band practice tonight, so i'll get to hear how it sounds with everybody else. i'm thankful for flatwound strings. i'm thankful for [kim

brand of chili bean paste we like best and also black vinegar, which you can have this stir fry without but which adds so much. i'm thankful that we had wendy's last night. i'm thankful for when the stoned cashier asked me what sauces i wanted with our chicken nuggets, i turned to ask d but found a totally different woman in her place, waiting in line behind me, and i'm thankful that we all laughed about this and the woman offered that she would like barbecue sauce. i'm thankful that our trip was inspired by [this eater article on the best fast food chicken nuggets](http://www.eater.com/2017/1/17/14248802/chicken-nuggets-ranked-fast-food-mcnugget), even though after sampling wendy's we both disagree (with d's preference being the classic mcnugget and mine being chik-fil-a's, despite/because of their \"aggressive salinity\").\n\ni'm thankful for _the young pope_, which i am still in love with. i'm thankful for the song \"[senza un perché](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z498JqZD_k),\" which is played on the show reminds me of both cate le bon and sheryl crow but is also italian. i'm thankful to have finally seen the address to the college of cardinals. i'm thankful for voiello. i'm thankful to still be reading life and fate, even though it is very sad—i'm thankful for when sad things can be very beautiful, like the letter sent by a mother trapped in a jewish ghetto by the nazis sent to her son, a physicist back in the soviet union. i'm thankful to have felt a rare desire to edit my notes from a few days ago, when i wrote that \"_history is less frightening than journalism right now, since at least it already happened and the world didn't end and we lived after it_,\" which is wrong because for a very many people, too many people, in the history i'm reading, the world did end and they didn't keep living. i'm thankful for the chance to revise that and to keep reading and learning. i'm thankful that [ruth

watched way more times than i ever watched _beauty and the beast_. i'm thankful for [a giant croissant filled with nutella and kinder
