  "body": "i'm thankful that yesterday evening d and i were lying on the couch watching reruns of _the office_ and miso was in the frisky mood she sometimes gets into in the evenings, which often takes the modality of us tug-of-war-ing with her over a cardboard paper towel tube or toilet paper tube (her favorite toys), and i was doing one of her favorite activities, which is to very firmly hold a piece of tube and lock my arm to my body so that there's no give and she has to pull as hard as she can to make any movement and she then shifted into something she's been doing a little more lately, which is that she likes to climb on my forearm and kind of wrestle with it in the air, sometimes trying to \"dig\" in my arm, which i find very cute, and then last night she had mounted my arm and she was for whatever reason in a very keyed up state which meant that she climbed up higher on my arm and, there is no other way to describe it, started humping it, which was a surprise as she has never had any sexual expression we've noticed since we've had her, but here she was last night on the couch, undeniably humping my arm, deborah and i could not stop laughing, if you were wondering about miso's fuck style it involves very rapid and wide hip thrusts, and she eventually dismounted but then reproduced the behavior several more times over the course of the evening, which made me laugh harder than i have in recent memory and also, given her relative to the norm placidity the rest of the evening, made me wonder whether her usual evening meanso state is a product of sexual frustration, in which case i would happily let her hump my arm every day if it would help lmao",
