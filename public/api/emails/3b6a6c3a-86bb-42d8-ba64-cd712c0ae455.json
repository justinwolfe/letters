(even though my coffee spilled on my leggings, i was so happy about the paper bag with both the bagel and the coffee that it didn’t ruin my day.) \n\ni’m thankful for the children of new york city; spoiled, struggling, laughing, crying. i’m thankful for those two adorable little boys who wanted to play the game i was playing on my phone, but went along with it when i said they couldn’t hold my phone but they could tell me where to move the pieces. i’m thankful that i was able to give their young dad a break for even three stops, because he looked really tired and the boys were very energetic. i’m thankful for the older kids, still in their school uniforms, that i saw on the platform a while ago, who were sitting on a railing looking ecstatic to be right where they were. i’m thankful that these sights force me to consider my own deep longing for and fear of having my own children, because sometimes it’s good for my emotions to practice being on their toes. even though i don’t have a boyfriend and could very possibly become a dog lady (like a cat lady only with dogs). \n\ni’m thankful that i’ve had to clear my cache a lot lately at work and that it brings even a few extra seconds of real awareness to my use of the internet because i can’t remember any of my passwords. \n\n\\- madeleine (2/29/16).",
