  "body": "i'm thankful for a good monday at work. i'm thankful for my new standing desk, which i put together over the weekend and which makes it possible for me to use an external monitor. i'm thankful for the extra screen space provided by the external monitor. i'm thankful that the problems i had to solve weren't too hard and the customers i worked with were nice and smart. i'm thankful that the thing i was worried about in my hormone-induced anxiety on sunday wasn't an issue at all. i'm thankful to have written the regular expression i needed for a certain task from scratch rather than just copying one from stack overflow, which was a big accomplishment for me (i'm thankful for [this site](http://regex101.com), which a coworker at my old job turned me onto and which is very helpful).\n\ni'm thankful that d finished the redesign of [roxane gay's website](http://www.roxanegay.com), which is the project she's been working very hard on for a while. i'm thankful for the site, which i think is so pretty and which reminds me of a wrapped present. i'm thankful for the geometric overlaps of color fields and for the restrained but punchy color. i'm thankful for the typography, which is something i always turn to d for assistance with in my own projects because she's so good at it. i'm thankful for the color changes as you hover over items on the writing pages. i'm thankful she just has to finish redoing roxane's tumblr and then she will be totally done with the project and will be able to rest and relax and play video games or online shop her evenings away instead of doing work after work.\n\ni'm thankful to have gotten home from dinner out last night in time to have apple cake for dessert. i'm thankful d and i watched episode 8 of this season of girls, which was amazing—i'm thankful to appreciate this show, which i've always thought was uneven but undeniably unique and interesting, more and more while watching this last season. i'm thankful for diary comics on \"[formats of potatoes i have recently enjoyed](https://twitter.com/melissagraeber/status/851634910481727488)\" and [the romance of boring word associations](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSuqKqCA2Tq/). i'm thankful that there is [a new chelsea peretti podcast](https://twitter.com/chelseaperetti/status/851611476863340548). i'm thankful while falling asleep last night to have started listening to the _[friends at the table](http://friendsatthetable.net/)_ podcast, which [seems interesting](http://careydraws.tumblr.com/post/144810140520/the-space-tragedy-season-of-streamfriendss). i'm thankful that we turned on the air conditioner in our bedroom for the first time all year last night. i'm thankful i was lazy about taking down the air conditioners in the fall and so just left them in the windows, which is nice now because i don't have to reinstall them. i'm thankful in the fall we are moving into a place with central air.\n\ni'm thankful to have discovered that the sound quality for my already excellent noise-cancelling headphones improves if i plug them into a sound source using a cable instead of using bluetooth. i'm thankful for the noticeable added clarity, which is lovely. i'm thankful for \"[sign of the times](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YDkzHVTEzMXZOVd1r5NqR),\" the new song by harry styles, which despite never really getting into 1d i love because it reminds me of \"[don't look back in anger](https://open.spotify.com/track/7CVYxHq1L0Z4G84jTDS6Jl),\" which is probably my favorite britpop song. i'm thankful for the chorus line \"just stop your cryin' it's a sign of the times', which he sings beautifully (i'm thankful for the assonance/slant rhyme of \"cryin'\" and \"times\"), and i'm thankful for the anthemic slide guitar; i'm thankful for half note space echo vocals and for stately piano and for whooshing synthesizers. i'm thankful for the other songs i listened to on my headphones, including \"[me and julio down by the schoolyard](https://open.spotify.com/track/6vxHp3CDNo0afgKGp2yi1E)\" and \"[needle in the hay](https://open.spotify.com/track/11Yx9ADkGhUJ4FuBjOewV4)\" and \"never be mine.\"\n\ni'm thankful that my dinner plans didn't get cancelled yesterday. i'm thankful to have biked to the restaurant in a t-shirt through perfect weather and am thankful that when i got there, i saw the people i was meeting (the professor (who is going up for tenure next year), the visiting lecturer (who got a teaching job in the fall in new york), and my old coworker (who just had her gallbladder taken out but is otherwise doing well)) were sitting at a table on the patio of the restaurant rather than inside (i'm thankful to apologize to the couple whose space i invaded when i opened a gate to the patio instead of going around to the other side, which is what i later realized i should have done). i'm thankful that the restaurants' food really improved over the last few times i had been (i'm thankful that they actually cooked my hamburger to the temperature i asked for) i'm thankful that we all had a really fun time gossiping about work and people and am thankful that we decided to meet up again before the visiting lecturer leaves for new york in june. i'm thankful that the sun slowly set as we sat outside and am thankful to have biked home in its last glimmers. i'm thankful it was supposed to rain but it never did.",
