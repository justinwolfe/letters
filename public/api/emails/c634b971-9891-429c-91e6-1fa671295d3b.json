Maybe more like affirmations, maybe prayers; either way, a different kind of form, I guess. It might seem silly the way I wrote them all out, like a waste of labor, but what I want to believe is that it's not a waste but instead a focusing, a channeling, a charge, that maybe the simple fact of my hand on the page today repeating the runes will do something for you, even if that thing is so small as to feel almost meaningless_\" and every sign's forecast was the same text \"_maybe today will be great and maybe it will suck and maybe it will be in between (probably) but anyway a week from now in retrospect it will make more sense or not but at least then you'll be through it and on to something else. i hope your today is okay, though, and maybe that hope will help_\"). i'm thankful to keep repeating the runes.\n\n1.  _dune 2_ poster outside the theater the day we went to see it\n\n2.  me reading in the attic with miso sitting behind me\n\n3.  delivery from eem, with papaya salad, fried rice, and white curry with brisket and cauliflower pictured\n\n4.  me writing some thank you notes with miso in my lap\n\n5.  miso\n\n6.  miso with a leftover chinese takeout container\n\n7.  miso dragging a stuffed pig my brother and his wife sent her away from us\n\n8.  me trying to get miso to give high fives to tiny plastic hands also sent by my brother and his wife\n\n9.  foccacia dough gleaming with oil![](/letters/images/280.jpg)\n\n10.  miso lying on the couch with the cardboard tube from a roll of aluminum foil\n\n11.  deborah petting miso in her lap\n\n12.  fresh flowers on deborah's desk\n\n13.  miso accepting pets while guarding a tiny piece of cardboard\n\n14.  me reading in the attack with miso beside me\n\n15.  me petting miso while reading in the attic\n\n16.  miso standing in the doorway of our bedroom waiting for second breakfast\n\n17.  deborah flexing her bicep after a workout in our basement\n\n18.  deborah and i in my office testing out the new webcam that didn't work on her computer but works on mine\n\n19.  deborah finishing her mise-en place for a broccoli, garlic, and mushroom pasta![](/letters/images/279.jpg)\n\n20.  graffiti on the side of the building depicting a house surrounded by wild overgrowth\n\n21.  picnic table outside a cafe with topo chico, san pellegrino, a pastry, shiba baggu, and notebook\n\n22.  wall of books in cafe\n\n23.  miso outside on a leash scampering outside\n\n24.  miso outside on a leash scampering outside as i talk about work while we walk\n\n25.  fork playing with trader joe's flat noodles mixed with sauteed brussels sprouts\n\n26.  opening joe sacco's graphic novel _palestine_\n\n27.  me playing distorted electric guitar![](/letters/images/281.png)\n\n28.  deborah petting miso who is guarding a small piece of cardboard\n\n29.  homemade larb ready for dinner\n\n30.  us sitting on the couch after dinner\n\n31.  miso trying to hump my leg while we sit on the couch after dinner\n\n32.  miso chewing on a small piece of cardboard\n\n33.  miso with the couch blanket in her mouth guarding that\n\n34.  deborah appreciating her hair in the bathroom mirror\n\n35.  panning shots of flowers in the sun\n\n36.  beginning of dogwoods flowering against blue sky\n\n37.  deborah blurred in the foreground with interesting clouds behind her\n\n38.  me eating something miso wants while reading, camera zooms in on miso's desire\n\n39.  deborah petting miso in the living room\n\n40.  reverse shot of 39 showing the sky outside the front window\n\n41.  deborah reading with miso in her lap\n\n42.  fresh sundubu in a dolsot on our coffee table\n\n43.  me playing bass while watching _the real world: new orleans_\n\n44.  me cradling miso who is annoyed to be cradled![](/letters/images/282.jpg)\n\n45.  comparison of new and old vacuum cleaner floor heads\n\n46.  me playing guitar while watching _survivor_\n\n47.  k pulling miso across the backyard in a wagon as frankie stands in the sun smiling\n\n48.  t grilling smashburgers with assistance from k\n\n49.  wide shot of me playing with and trying to record video of miso and frankie\n\n50.
