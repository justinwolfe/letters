  "body": "I'm thankful that I'm on a job that could be categorized at the very top of my \"worst jobs ever worked\" list. \n\nI'm thankful that it makes me recognize the importance of an overall creative vision and the real value of working with an agency. We're working directly with a client and they have no idea what they are doing. I realize that my job is made a lot easier when I have someone who is able to defend a strong point of view. I'm thankful that I'm learning to speak up and defend some choices creatively and let others go. I'm thankful that I feel like I'm really getting better at being a good at my job. \n\nI'm thankful for the call at 6pm where I expended a lot of energy keeping my voice positive and uplifting while talking with m about why this project is costing her more money and what the plan should be. I'm thankful that I think that the positivity really helped and she wasn't as touchy or as cold at the end of the call as she was at the beginning. I'm thankful that I know that these type of calls completely leave me feeling drained at the end and that I know to take a few minutes after to just breathe and drink water and take a step outside the windowless room we work in when we're editing.  \n\nI'm really thankful for my team and how funny they are. I'm pretty sure we're all a bit crazy from the project, but it is enough to say that we're laughing until we're crying a few times every day. I'm thankful for tears from laughter. I'm thankful for meeting new people on a bad new project who are okay with being a bit too silly and a bit loopy at 7pm on a friday. I'm thankful for people who can be loopy and silly that and also really get shit done. It makes the bad a whole lot better. \n\nI'm thankful to be able to send them emails at the end of the day with [this gif](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-06/24/11/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-31294-1403623329-16.gif) and say \"WE GOT THIS\". \n\nI'm thankful for otters at the end of a very long friday.\n\n\\- esmé (4/15/16).
