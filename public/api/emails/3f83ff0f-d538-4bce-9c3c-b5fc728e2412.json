  "body": "i’m thankful that Ariel, Nico, and Noelle had a similar mix of feelings that made me feel less alone. i’m thankful that people like Nico exist in the criminal justice system. i’m thankful that Ariel and Noelle will be a part of children's lives. i’m thankful that Noelle is still optimistic and energetic after her first year of teaching. i’m thankful the rain let up enough that we could talk through things enough to unwind the knot in my stomach. i’m thankful that everyone noticed that the clouds looked like they do in Toy Story. i’m thankful that the weather made it feel like the earth was compliant in the healing agenda everyone needed after this week.\n\ni’m thankful that Jas texted me thursday afternoon to tell me i’m loved and valued. i’m thankful that i’m old enough to know the true value of my blackness and not confuse that with how much the media runs to the contrary. i’m thankful that everyone got the same sense of alarm and disgust from how many times they’ve shown black men gunned down on tv. i’m thankful that my friends gave me space to sort through my own feelings.\n\ni’m thankful there was a public bathroom with a good hand dryer at the foot of the building i had an interview in. i’m thankful that the hand dryer was really good at drying the shirt i sweat through 15 minutes before my interview. i’m thankful i could see the humor in this situation. i’m thankful the sweat blotch that reappeared wasn’t too distracting. i’m thankful i could acknowledge it by saying “really hot” when my interviewer asked how I was doing. i’m thankful he found it as funny as i did.\n\ni’m thankful that there was enough funny stuff on the internet that samuel and i can send each other gifs and videos. i’m thankful that the people around me know how to help me maintain my sanity. i’m thankful that i’m encouraged to heal from all the news this week. i’m thankful that the world will know #blacklivesmatter.\n\ni’m thankful thank you notes is a newsletter everyone can subscribe to: [http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes)\n\n\\- Jerome McLeod (07/11/2016). looking for analyst job in advertising.
