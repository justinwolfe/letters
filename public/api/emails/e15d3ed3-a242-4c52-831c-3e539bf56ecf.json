  "body": "i'm thankful that though i woke up at 3am and couldn't go back to sleep for a while, i eventually was able to go back to sleep. i'm thankful that this kind of twilight interlude is a rarity now, when it used to be the case every night. i'm thankful that when i was cleaning out the kitchen cupboards on the weekend, i found a bag of old cough drops and am thankful that instead of throwing them away, i stuck them in the medicine cabinet. i'm thankful for the mild oral anaesthetic in them, which helped the sore throat that woke me hurt a bit less. i'm thankful to have gargled with salt water, even though it didn't really seem to do anything. i'm thankful for the sensation of drinking regular water after gargling with salt water, for the revelation of its taste. i'm thankful that hopefully my sore throat will go away on its own, like the last time i had a sore throat, but am thankful i have insurance and money to pay the co-pay and access to a doctor if it doesn't.\n\ni'm thankful, when i'm stuck awake in the middle of the night, to be involved in a good book. i'm thankful to be reading _[anathem](https://www.amazon.com/Anathem-Neal-Stephenson-ebook/dp/B0015DPXKI/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1479904260&sr=8-1)_, which i started a few times in the past but couldn't get into but have gotten quite into this time around. i'm thankful for the opening section's intricate descriptions of a strange chapel holding an enormous mechanical clock and the monks who sing at certain times the clock chimes. i'm thankful that the book's wordplay doesn't annoy me as much as it did in the past, that i maybe even like it now. i'm thankful for the narrator, who has an interesting complex viewpoint and am thankful for the way that the book conveys the complex history of the society he lives in. i'm thankful, though, that the book is not all world and ideas, but that there are complex characters within it too.\n\ni'm thankful we have continued to watch _luther_ (i'm thankful we are now halfway through the second season), which continues to be ridiculous but at the same time quite engaging. i'm thankful for how the narrative/police use of CCTV cameras adds to the unique britishness of the series. i'm thankful for the computer hacker/IT guy character, who always looks so sweet. i'm thankful that there is a character named justin, because there are rarely characters named justin on TV shows.\n\ni'm thankful for the burritos i made yesterday and the day before and will make today. i'm thankful to have gotten the filling proportions and layout just right. i'm thankful that we still haven't decided what to eat on thanksgiving, but will decide soon (i'm thankful since it's just us we can be spontaneous). i'm thankful that [wesley morris dislikes turkey](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/podcasts/tips-for-shoring-up-a-fragile-thanksgiving.html?_r=0) as much as i do. i'm thankful to remember nice family thanksgivings at my grandparents' house playing with my cousins. i'm thankful to remember the times i got to break the turkey's wishbone and for the times within that set where it broke in my favor.\n\ni'm thankful i meditated yesterday before work. i'm thankful that work was hard but not impossible. i'm thankful that i made some progress on a work project that i hadn't had time to get to in weeks. i'm thankful for the [medium things](http://tinyletter.com/mediumthings) tinyletter. i'm thankful for [this bundle of 151 cool indie games](https://itch.io/b/149/a-good-bundle), the proceeds of which will support planned parenthood and the ACLU. i'm thankful that [chelsea peretti recorded a new podcast](https://twitter.com/chelseaperetti/status/801147322612617216) and am thankful to have remembered that i didn't write about how there was a great new episode of _[food on franklin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/food-on-franklin/id1057688014?mt=2)_ where hamilton nolan betrays a weird understanding of the composition of bread. i'm thankful for the [fried egg jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phacellophora_camtschatica).",
