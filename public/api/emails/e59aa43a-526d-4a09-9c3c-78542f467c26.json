He tells me that my life is empty, but it isn't quite because I bought some pot today_.\"\n\ni'm thankful for air conditioning. i'm thankful that though it was so hot yesterday evening that even with the air conditioning on full blast for a while that it still felt hot, the air conditioning did help some and eventually helped more. i'm thankful that in two months we are moving into a place with central air, which sounds wonderful. i'm thankful that after 5 days of calling CVS i have still not gotten my new antidepressant prescription and have to call my doctor today to check on whether they received the insurance authorization paperwork (1) and actually sent it to my insurance (2) so that perhaps I can get the brand name version of the drug since the generic is on a long backorder. i'm thankful to have found out that without insurance authorization/copay a month of the medication would cost $400, thankful for the reminder of how shitty our health care system is and how deeply wrong and immoral it is that republicans want to make it much worse. i'm thankful that i have insurance and that though the process is slow and frustrating it will hopefully end with me getting medicine i can plug into my brain to feel better/stronger/happier.\n\ni'm thankful for [andy's diary](https://twitter.com/WarholLives/status/874272585596289024). i'm thankful for [this unintentional self portrait](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/874422397750923264) from my inbox. i'm thankful for [these poems](https://twitter.com/monicaheisey/status/874238657133248513). i'm thankful for [this hypnotic needle felting video](https://twitter.com/WarholLives/status/874272585596289024). i'm thankful for \"[a.d.i.d.a.s](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Ol9JFw2Icl79oTqH1sG4t)\" (i'm thankful for sleepy brown and thankful roses are free) and i'm thankful for [the new grizzly bear song](https://open.spotify.com/track/18RnM1YySlG8IWK0ivr2a3), which is propulsive and catchy in a way their other songs aren't imo, and i'm thankful still for \"[bad liar](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fZQIJew3nkNe99s2PKzul)\", which is really just a perfectly constructed and produced song (the minimalism of the verses, the bouncing throb of the bass, the drop-out before the chorus that leads into the higher register melody like a gull diving to the water and then swooping back up toward the sun at the last second). i'm thankful for \"[kathleen perry](https://twitter.com/priya_ebooks/status/874555291160920064),\" which is the best diss name i've heard since \"[candle jenner](https://twitter.com/Saisailu97/status/870663333371760641).\" i'm thankful for the summer return of [the world's most joyful meme](https://twitter.com/geekylonglegs/status/874424702130946049), which you owe it to yourself to start your day by watching several times. i'm thankful you don't need a jacket.",
