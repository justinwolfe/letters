i'm thankful that when i talk to my parents, who work in the service industry and manufacturing, about some of the perks of my tech job like this, for their shocked reactions, which i'm thankful for how happy they are for me to get to have an easier life than they had but i'm also thankful for the perspective of their surprise as a way of not forgetting how lucky i am to be in this position). \n\ni'm thankful that though i had this horrible clench in the right side of my body from my jaw through my neck and shoulders and down into my hip yesterday, which was a discomfort and distraction through a day that should have been pure relaxation and which no amount of yoga or theragun or spike mat would unlock, eventually before dinner i took some advil (which i should have done much sooner) and it helped a lot (i'm thankful to write this so next time i'll hopefully think to take it earlier). i'm thankful that casa amor (the period of _love island_ where the producers inject new personalities to try to fracture the fledgling relationships that have formed in the first section of the show and thus the most entertaining portion) just started and that there will be a new episode to watch tonight, with fried chicken and watermelon.",
