  "body": "i'm thankful for my wife d today and yesterday and every day forever. i'm more thankful for her than anyone or anything else in the world. i'm thankful for how drunk i was when i first met her, at a student orientation, and how cool i thought she was and how i luckily didn't embarrass myself too much. i'm thankful for the tokidoki tennis shoes she wore that caught my eye with their tiny cartoon tigers and gave me something to banter about with her. i'm thankful for sitting next to her in our writing workshop, even if it really annoyed our friend c one time. i'm thankful for her asking for my phone number after reading a love story i wrote and i'm thankful for our early tentative texts about celebrity crushes (which were really proxies for discussion of actual crushes). i'm thankful for our early dates, for the time we ate sandwiches for lunch on high stools in a crappy underground restaurant, i'm thankful for the time we went to macy's to buy her dad a tie for his birthday, and i'm thankful for the time she invited me over to her house one night for beers and i was allergic to her roommate's many cats and she was impressed by how many followers my defunct tumblr blog had. i'm thankful she tolerated my dismissal of literary magazines and my incredible ego.\n\ni'm thankful for the day five years ago, after a party where we spent what felt like hours away from everyone else sitting side by side on a sofa, the outsides of our thighs pressing against each other, when she texted me and said that we needed to talk. i'm thankful that she was brave enough, over yellow curry at a tibetan restaurant, to say that she wanted us to be exclusive and i'm thankful that i agreed. i'm thankful for the awkward hug and first kiss we shared beside her car outside my old apartment before she went to california for thanksgiving break.\n\ni will never be thankful enough for her, but i'm thankful for the opportunity to keep trying.",
