  "body": "i'm thankful for gene wilder, who passed away yesterday and who was a great actor. i'm thankful to remember one summer day when i was a child when my parents presented my brother and i with a variety tub of wonka candies and sat us down in front of a vhs of _charlie and the chocolate factory_. i'm thankful for how the flavor and sugar fed the fires of our already strong imaginations, making the fantasy seem realer. i'm thankful to remember watching _young frankenstein_ with my dad and finding that a movie that he loved when he was young was still so funny to me. i'm thankful for the little joke when gene wilder's character is complaining about the grossness of grave robbery to igor and igor said \"_could be worse, could be raining_,\" and then there is theatrical lightning and thunder and it starts to pour. \n\ni'm thankful to remember one day my freshman year of college visiting the sandwich shop/convenience store behind my dorm with my friends a and z. i'm thankful that the employee that day was telling people what characters from movies they looked like as she made their sandwiches. i'm thankful that, i guess because i had brown curly hair and a slight twinkle in my eye, she said i looked like willy wonka. i'm thankful she said my friend a looked like \"a bully in an eighties movie\" which was accurate. i'm thankful, though, most of all that she looked at my friend z and pondered who he looked at for longer than a and i combined, then suddenly had a flash of inspiration and said \"you look like that lady from _the hand that rocks the cradle_!\" i'm thankful that we found this so funny, that z (who was a young man) looked like the lady from _the hand that rocks the cradle_, which is rebecca de mornay. i'm thankful that we could not stop laughing about this that night, that after we returned to my dorm room and ate our sandwiches i made a photoshop collage comparing photos of z to photos of rebecca de mornay.\n\ni'm thankful for our air conditioners, which work wonderfully, even though their noise drives me slightly crazy at times. i'm thankful to fantasize about being so rich i could hire dyson to create a perfectly silent air conditioning system for my house. i'm thankful for the new protein powder d ordered for us, which is tiramisu flavored. i'm thankful that it is not so sweet as the other powder but is still sweet enough to feel like a treat. i'm thankful for black seedless grapes and thankful for the cold cut sandwiches we are having for dinner this week, because it seems too hot to cook. i'm thankful for banana peppers in salty brine and thankful for the wetness of sliced tomatoes and thankful for brown mustard spread to the edges of slices of bread.\n\ni'm thankful for essential oils, which are the latest sub-medicinal health hobby i have chosen to spend my hard-earned money on. i'm thankful for [the little inhalers](https://www.amazon.com/Aromatherapy-Essential-Inhaler-Medical-Plastic/dp/B00MJDON2M/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1472557780&sr=8-2&keywords=essential+oils+inhalers) i bought off amazon and thankful for the cotton wicks inside, which i soak with orange or peppermint or lavender essence. i'm thankful that i don't know if the oils have any actual direct effect, but i'm thankful for the ritual of using them and the way that it helps me to pay more attention to my breath, which is something i especially struggle with during the workday.\n\ni'm thankful that my vacation request for october was approved and thankful also yesterday to have suddenly realized that i have a three day weekend this weekend because of labor day. i'm thankful that though yesterday was intense at times, it was a good day and i felt good at the end of it. i'm thankful that i got to spend a good amount of time working on a knowledge base article and thankful that i feel like it's going really well. i'm thankful that i was able to help my new coworker out with some troubleshooting advice and thankful that he's really nice and appreciative. i'm thankful for the [saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) testing tool, which i'd never used but which is cool, even if the name of it calls to mind an experimental pizza restaurant.\n\ni'm thankful, too, [to have realized that \"flowers are plant genitals](https://twitter.com/magicmolly/status/770068266530312192).\" i'm thankful for [georgia o'keeffe](https://www.visartsatrockville.org/more/event/georgia-okeefes-red-poppy-5/). i'm thankful for \"[tfw a sad thought seamlessly segues into another sad thought like the way the DJ transitions from one song to the next](https://twitter.com/SafyHallanFarah/status/770510099756363776).\" i'm thankful that [dreaming is free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUJq4GN7UXE).",
