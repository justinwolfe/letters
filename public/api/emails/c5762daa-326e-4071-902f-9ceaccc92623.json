an old episode of \\[food on

there was in the feed, just uploaded, a new episode. i'm thankful for food on franklin, which is the most soothing and gently hilarious podcast i know. i'm thankful for the moment in the latest food on franklin when taylor berman mentions making a pumpkin pie and accidentally leaving out a cup of sugar and how that reminds me of when d made pumpkin pie and also forgot the sugar (i'm thankful that despite her embarrassment, the pie was still edible, with a little maple syrup and a lot of whipped cream, and i'm thankful that she made another a few days later). i'm thankful that i didn't hurt myself while running and i'm thankful that i had the target on the other side of town as my goal (or, rather, target (i’m thankful for puns)). i'm thankful that though the target was ransacked, i was able to find a few small cheap packages of the white lights that d requested to make the house more festive. i'm thankful that i bought a specially flavored coke and cherry package of tic tacs, even if i remembered after eating too many how bad they are for my teeth and how i shouldn't eat them. i'm thankful that even while carrying a big shopping bag on one arm, i still passed multiple joggers

thankful that even though i prefer talking on the phone with them, i've gotten better at exchanging texts and emails with my parents, which i used to find challenging. i'm thankful for both synchronous and asynchronous forms. i'm thankful for the holiday beer sampler, from which my favorite was either the cappucino stout or the cinnamon horchata ale. i'm thankful that i restrained myself and did not add a shot of whiskey on top of my dinner beer like i wanted to. i'm thankful for the kale and mixed greens and sliced grape salad i made and i'm thankful for the half of a sesame seed
