  "body": "i'm thankful that since it's our last morning house-sitting and the sheets will have to be washed anyway, after breakfast we let the dog get up into the bed with us. i'm thankful for how happy this made the dog, who has been trying to do this all week and who is currently curled into a bun and leaned against d's knees, and who just a moment ago was sprawled out on his back as we both scratched his belly and neck. i'm thankful that it has been really lovely this week to have a dog and to know that i will miss having this dog in my life. i'm thankful that we might try taking him to the park later.\n\ni'm thankful for this nice experience with this dog, especially because i know d wants us to have a dog eventually and i am usually more resistant to that. i'm thankful that i do worry about my time and how a dog's needs can consume that time, preventing me from doing activities that i know i need to do to take care of myself (i haven't done yoga or qigong or meditated the whole time we've been here), but at the same time i know that loving the dog is a kind of self care in its own way, and not just self care for me, but also care for the dog, which makes it doubly virtuous. i'm thankful that we can't get a dog any time soon because of our living situation and that's good, since i'm not fully convinced, but i'm thankful that spending the week with this dog made having a dog feel possible in a way i hadn't felt it before. i'm thankful for how happy the dog is when i rub him or wrestle him or play tug of war with him and for our evening ritual of d giving him a tiny piece of salami while i make our sandwiches for dinner. i'm thankful for how happy he is when i run with him and chase him outside.\n\ni'm thankful, though, to be able to go back to our house and to our normal lives at the end of the day today. i'm thankful to hope that i never have to clean a litterbox again and i'm thankful to know that d feels the same way on that front. i'm thankful that our house is much smaller than this house, which makes everything feel much more convenient. i'm thankful that i didn't enter virtual reality on thursday night, because i needed a break, or on friday night, because they dog was resting beside me on the couch and it felt cruel and wrong to disturb our connection. i'm thankful that my new ereader is coming today. i'm thankful that i think i figured out the problem i was having with setting up my raspberry pi and i'm thankful to think that means i'll be able to get it up and running this weekend. i'm thankful that d got us a dozen donuts from the best donut shop in town. i'm thankful for excessive jelly filling.\n\ni'm thankful that _big little lies_ got me listening to neil young's album _harvest moon_, which is wonderful. i'm thankful that d set up a VPN so we can watch episodes of _terrace house: aloha state_ that have been released in Japan but not here (i'm thankful they still have english subs!). i'm thankful to have been absolutely and completely crushed by the season finale of the first season; i'm thankful for how good _terrace house_ is at capturing the intensity of human moments, both happy ones and sad ones. i'm thankful that my other favorite show, _the americans_, is back and as intense and human as always. i'm thankful for when stan describes the woman he is dating to phillip as \"_like a female version of you_\" (which made me laugh) and another moment where stan's partner recommends a restaurant based on the fact that they have a translucent abby grand piano. i'm thankful for the moment in the most recent episode where a character rubs her thumb and finger together as a tactic to anchor herself in a storm of emotions.\n\ni'm thankful for [this poem](https://theawl.com/a-poem-by-patricia-lockwood-6c0845ba6057#.yn4n805c9) \"about helplessness, and the small strange impulses that live in the tips of your fingers.\" i'm thankful for _parable of the talents_, which becomes more and more eerie the closer it tracks to the world we live in. i'm thankful for [this humble bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/women-of-scifi-and-fantasy-book-bundle) of sci-fi and fantasy books by women, which includes the two _parable_ books. i'm thankful for [this game jam](http://kotaku.com/you-should-play-these-games-about-political-resistance-1793296195) for games about \"resisting oppressive authoritarianism in all its forms.\" i'm thankful for [george and mary oppen](http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/when-the-oppens-gave-up-art-to-fight-fascism). i'm thankful for [this meditation to inner defenses](https://twitter.com/yumisakugawa/status/842068150925512704). i'm thankful for [this message on joy as resistance](https://twitter.com/AyeshaASiddiqi/status/842541692561457153), even though i know that joy can't be the only resistance. i'm thankful that \"[instead of reading eckhart tolle you can eat a bunch of LSD](https://twitter.com/thexteens/status/842978981632651271).\" i'm thankful for mira gonzalez's [wisdom tooth art](https://twitter.com/miragonz/status/842093667422629888) and her [bedtime pasta](https://twitter.com/miragonz/status/841898766626086913). i'm thankful for [graffiti](https://twitter.com/womensart1/status/843002015697551360). i'm thankful for [this wonderful letter](http://tinyletter.com/sanaa/letters/names) about the depth of the meanings of the terms we use to refer to people in our lives. i'm thankful for the opportunity to get [this beautiful looking book](https://www.instagram.com/p/BRwY4kDBMA4/?taken-by=cosmopsis) of pictures of \"not bad\" sunsets.",
