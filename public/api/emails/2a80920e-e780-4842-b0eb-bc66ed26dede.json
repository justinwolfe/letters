But put something down so that you can embrace. In the purple room you will find a letter you wrote. Now is the time to consider sending it. You will wear your favorite things._\n\ni'm thankful for thinking that i surely had an extra quarter inch to 3.5mm cable converter somewhere in my \"misc music stuff\" box and though it wasn't there, i then realized another junk-drawer-esque box had one buried in the bottom of it. i'm thankful for the fuzzy bunny baseball hat d bought. i'm thankful to not have to pretend that i have any interest in either celebrating easter or watching sports.",
