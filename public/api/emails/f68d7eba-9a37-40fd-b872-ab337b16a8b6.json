  "body": "i'm thankful that it's saturday and i'm still in bed. i'm thankful for saturdays when it's nice outside and we can go for walks, but i'm also thankful for saturdays when it's rainy and there's nowhere to go. i'm thankful to have gotten through another week of work and thankful at the end of the day to have helped out my coworker with a workaround for a bug that was driving her crazy. i'm thankful that while i let myself get too aggravated by a bug that was driving me crazy earlier in the day, i figured out a workaround for that too, and am thankful that though i was on the verge of expressing my frustration to the customer, i remained polite and pleasant. i'm thankful for the nice okra i got from the grocery store, even if i slightly over-roasted it. i'm thankful for the frozen chicken nuggets we got free because of a coupon. i'm thankful, since we have not had much good corn this summer, for the corn on the cob i got at the grocery store. i'm thankful that they have a trashcan by the corn in the grocery store so you can shuck your corn there rather than having to deal with the mess of doing it at home. i'm thankful to remember when i was a kid my mom sending me out into the backyard with a bag of corn to shuck and insisting, when i tried to come back in after doing a shoddy job, to do a better job of getting the corn silk off of it first. i'm thankful that as an adult, going outside is a choice that i take pleasure in rather than something that's imposed on me and enforced by an authority figure. i'm thankful for the constant beat of the cicadas, even though i hate the constant beat of the cicadas, since it's one of those small signals (like the sudden dearth of berries which just a few weeks ago were so abundant) that the seasons are slowly changing.",
