\n\nthat is my review of buttondown so far: it's a small product built by a couple of people and there are some occasional rough edges or quirks or limitations that you might not see on a larger platform and who knows how durable it might be (i launched my first paid newsletter in the summer of 2012 on an app, letter.ly, that promptly died in the fall of 2012), but overall i'm very happy with it (i will write another time about some of their features and design choices that i haven't seen elsewhere and that i enjoy).\n\nanyway, to wrap up, the point of this email is i wanted to celebrate my favorite tinyletter, [pome](https://tinyletter.com/pome), which i think was originally called _lunch poems_ and was, over six seasons over even more years, [a daily poem curated by matthew ogle](https://medium.com/@flaneur/365-days-of-pome-a75bb02d8d06). matthew used the tinyletter deprecation announcement as an exit and i don't begrudge him, even if i will miss his taste in poetry, which has been foundational for my own and has provided so much light to my days. here's the last poem he chose, by ron padgett:\n\n```\nPoem\n\nI’m in the house.\nIt’s nice out: warm\nsun on cold snow.\nFirst day of spring\nor last of winter.\nMy legs run down\nthe stairs and out\nthe door, my top\nhalf here typing\n```\n\nas we celebrate poetry, which we have to keep doing forever, i think of adorno and no poetry after auschwitz, and so instead of closing with that poem, i'll close with [this one](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/154658/fuck-your-lecture-on-craft-my-people-are-dying) you may have seen recently and which is all bars.\n\n```\nFuck Your Lecture on Craft, My People Are Dying\nBY NOOR HINDI\nColonizers write about flowers.\nI tell you about children throwing rocks at Israeli tanks\nseconds before becoming daisies.\nI want to be like those poets who care about the moon.\nPalestinians don’t see the moon from jail cells and prisons.\nIt’s so beautiful, the moon.\nThey’re so beautiful, the flowers.\nI pick flowers for my dead father when I’m sad.\nHe watches Al Jazeera all day.\nI wish Jessica would stop texting me Happy Ramadan.\nI know I’m American because when I walk into a room something dies.\nMetaphors about death are for poets who think ghosts care about sound.\nWhen I die, I promise to haunt you forever.\nOne day, I’ll write about the flowers like we own them.\n```\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/569.jpg)",
