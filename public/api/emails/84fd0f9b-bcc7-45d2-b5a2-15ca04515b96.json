  "body": "i'm thankful that work continues to be very hard but that i continue to do it. i'm thankful for the way that hard work bonds the members of my team, that i feel more connected with them because we had to face the challenge of yesterday together. i'm thankful for gallows humor. i'm thankful that i do feel like i'm getting better at my job, that i know more and am better at quickly figuring out the answers to the things i don't know, even if that doesn't seem to result in the job being less stressful. i'm thankful to be hopeful that eventually it will. i'm thankful that next week, we have our annual company retreat, where we'll all get to spend time together in person having fun. i'm thankful that i finished a new version of a tool i made for our internal use and am thankful for [GM\\_xmlhttpRequest](https://github.com/scriptish/scriptish/wiki/GM_xmlhttpRequest), which made the upgrade possible.\n\ni'm thankful that jk emailed d and i yesterday afternoon because she was going to visit our friend nl in kentucky and had lost her phone. i'm thankful that d still had nl's phone number in her phone and that though i didn't, i was able to respond to jk, who i owe a long email that i haven't finished because of being tired from my new job. i'm thankful to have, because of the circumstances, even though i'm sorry she lost her phone, had an opportunity to make contact with her briefly, to show her that i care. i'm thankful that maybe i will have the energy to finish the email this weekend. i'm thankful that i am generally better at returning emails than i used to be, even if i'm still not perfect at it. i'm thankful to not be perfect at it, and to have been worse in the past, which helps me to not be so annoyed when i'm annoyed that someone didn't reply to an email i sent them.\n\ni'm thankful that after dinner yesterday, d and went on a stroll through the neighborhood. i'm thankful i was able to convince d to bring along some white wine for herself in a small glass jar. i'm thankful for the facetime call we had with my parents, during which i learned some nice news about my brother. i'm thankful for the temperature outside, which was perfect and reminded me of how in miami in deep summer the ocean is the same temperature as the air (or your body, i can't remember) such that there's no adjustment period when you immerse yourself. i'm thankful that i took us down some of the narrow little alleys that can be used to traverse our neighborhood and thankful that d saw several rare and beautiful breeds of flowers. i'm thankful that my parents are watching the great british bakeoff.\n\ni'm thankful for \"[the boys are back in town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQo1HIcSVtg).\" i'm thankful for the tones and chords that are played, which escape the blues of the pentatonic for sweeter major pastures. i'm thankful, during the breakdown, for the whispery voice hissing \"_the boys are back_\" before the harmonized guitar solo kicks in. i'm thankful for [this twitter bot](https://twitter.com/intownagain) devoted to tweeting lyrics and guitar parts from the song. i'm thankful for the similarly sunshined lines of \"[i'm a cuckoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kguL9BhXhA)\" by belle and sebastian. i'm thankful for \"[man on the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qme48Uy55M)\" by britney spears, which has a really pretty melody and i think is my favorite song from her new album. i'm thankful for \"[man on the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hKSYgOGtos)\" by rem, which i also like, but not as much. i'm thankful for the silliness of when britney sings in other languages or with bad accents.\n\ni'm thankful for the conversation the pharmacist and i had about the blue background wallpaper of the screen on the credit card terminal. i'm thankful to have gotten my prozac prescriptions, even though because of some scheduling slip-ups, i had to go back to cvs multiple times to get them. i'm thankful that i was out running every morning anyway, so i didn't really mind, but i'm also thankful i have them now and so don't have to go back this morning. i'm thankful that when d went out to the post office yesterday, she stopped and bought me a small delicious piece of chocolate. i'm thankful for this hilarious discussion of [\"brunch flavored\" candy corn](https://twitter.com/alliewach/status/776201432416518144).",
