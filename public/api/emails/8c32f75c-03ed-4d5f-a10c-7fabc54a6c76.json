  "body": "i'm thankful that my plantar fasciitis has been getting better and i've been able to go running outside more without having to limp around the rest of the day. i'm thankful that i know that not too soon but soon enough it will be too cold to run outside comfortably (though i enjoy running outside when it's cold in a different way) and that i should take advantage of it now. i'm thankful for the way the 10 day forecast puts a kind of frame on the short term future, that i can look at it and say \"_okay, it's still warm for now._\" i'm thankful for the saltiness of my sweat in the summer. i'm thankful for summer music, which is the best kind of music, and that i can listen to it for a while longer (though i'm also excited for fall and winter music).\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday was a good day at work. i'm thankful that it was the first day i was on call to help other people on my team with their questions and that i think i did a good job and it didn't have too much of an effect on doing my regular work. i'm thankful for the kind engineer who reached out to me about helping me get a development environment set up so i can start making pull requests for the tool. i'm thankful, when he asked why i hadn't tried doing it before and i said, in part, that i was kind of intimidated because i don't come from a computer science background and don't feel i always do things \"the right way,\" he told me he didn't come from a computer science background either and sent a:) and told me about the process in a way that didn't seem intimidating and made me feel comfortable. i'm thankful to be excited about the possibility to contribute in a new way and grow my skills.\n\ni'm thankful that today i was able to quit taking the new antidepressant that had all the bad effects and go back to taking prozac. i'm thankful that i am already, after a few days of going down to half doses of the new antidepressant, sleeping easier and better and not feeling quite so anxious all the time. i'm thankful to hope that continues and that going back on the prozac works okay, at least for now. i'm thankful that my doctor put in my request for a referral to see a psychiatrist and they should call me about making an appointment in the next few days. i'm thankful to be hopeful that i will find something or some combination things that will work better in the future.\n\ni'm thankful for [this lasagna](http://www.cookmarked.com/recipe/Simple-Lasagna-with-Hearty-TomatoMeat-Sauce-Cooks-Illustrated--viCoCnP9xImNJMSIjd780PIyZ5YTkJfWDnuHpClxiJUe), which is what we're having for dinner this week. i'm thankful to have let myself have a small glass of red wine with dinner the last few nights. i'm thankful for chocolate bars. i'm thankful that i am still getting good nectarines from the supermarket, but also good pears. i'm thankful for doritos dinamita chips, which are sour and spicy and salty and a great accompaniment to the apple slices smeared with gobs of peanut butter i've been having for lunch. i'm thankful for the large blue mason jars i use as drinking glasses, which keep me hydrated. i'm thankful for ice cubes and for cold water.",
