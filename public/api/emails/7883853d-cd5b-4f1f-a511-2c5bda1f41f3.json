  "body": "i'm thankful that i have been managing to fit lots of things into my mornings this week—i'm thankful that yesterday, i not only was able to write my notes and have a run on the treadmill and pop over to the grocery store for a tide pen for d but also to take a bath before work started. i'm thankful for the episode of _the amazing race_ i watched on the treadmill even though the central motif of the episode was a husband being unkind to his wife/teammate as they completed a series of difficult challenges high in the swiss alps. i'm thankful for the way that watching it and seeing how statements which the husband maybe didn't consciously mean to be hurtful (but which _were_ clearly hurtful, from an outside perspective, and which clearly did hurt his wife) made me think about similarly hurtful statements i've made to d in the past. i'm thankful for the way that watching the situation from the outside touched a nerve inside of me and that because of this emotional hyperlink will hopefully be called forth by my mind in a future time and help me to not say a hurtful thing to the person i love.\n\ni'm thankful for the \"[hateful things](http://www.basicincome.com/bp/hatefulthings.htm)\" section of _the pillow book_. i'm thankful for the album _devotion_ by beach house, which is one of my favorite albums of all time and which i hadn't listened to in a while. i'm thankful for organ drones floating in seas of reverb. i'm thankful for celestial slide guitar, divorced from the context of country music or hawaiian slack key. i'm thankful for simple drum machine patterns. i'm thankful for victoria legrand's voice, which sounds like nothing else in the world. i'm thankful for meditative repetitions. i'm thankful for the air of mystery but how that mystery is not a sad or melancholy thing, that the mystery is infused with major chords and major key melodies. i'm thankful for \"[heart of chambers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNQ97P0rQk8)\" which was my first favorite song on the album (i'm thankful for the way that the chorus slams into the end of the verse) and for \"[d.a.r.l.i.n.g.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=401kE39Xvwg)\" (thankful for the multi-colored wavery slide hook) or \"[home again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us7BzvNVDcE)\" (thankful for the epic overlapping vocals of the final chorus) which are my favorites now.\n\ni'm thankful for the mid-year sale on the playstation store, where i bought a bunch of deeply discounted games yesterday evening. i'm thankful that i set them all to download last night and that i'll be able to play some of them this weekend. i'm thankful for the one that downloaded quickly and so i played a little bit of, _knock knock_. i'm thankful it's made by a developer who made one of the most intriguing games i've ever read about ([1](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/10/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body/), [2](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/11/butchering-pathologic-part-2-the-mind/), [3](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/12/butchering-pathologic-part-3-the-soul/))(i'm thankful that game is being rereleased this year). i'm thankful that _knock knock_, a game in which you guide a (hallucinating?) insomniac around a constantly shapeshifting house turning lights on and off while he is haunted by various mysterious things, is interesting so far, if a bit flat. i'm thankful, even if it's kind of confusing, that the game doesn't really tell you what to do and isn't obvious in the way that lots of games are today. i'm thankful for the old-fashioned dressing gown the player character wears.\n\ni'm thankful that yesterday was the best day at my new job so far. i'm thankful that for the first time, as i finished my training exercises, i started to feel like this is a job i will be able to do and will be good at and will enjoy (i'm thankful to cross my fingers here, to avoid a jinx). i'm thankful for that, very much. i'm thankful also that it is the friday today and thankful that it is the friday before a three day weekend. i'm thankful for the meal box meal we made last night, which was sauteed chicken breasts over a zucchini and green bean cacciatore. i'm thankful it was tasty even if, while we finished cooking, i was having a bad stomachache (i think because i didn't eat enough earlier in the day, distracted by work) and so didn't finish mine. i'm thankful for the toffee klondike bar i had a bit later in the eveningwhen my stomach was feeling better. i'm thankful for chocolate and ice cream and the combination of the two.",
