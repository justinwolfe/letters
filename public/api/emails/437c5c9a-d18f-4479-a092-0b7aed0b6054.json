  "body": "i'm thankful that even though it's monday, i'm happy because i know that next monday, i'll be on vacation. i'm thankful that it rained overnight and that when i woke up, it was still raining. i'm thankful for the extra darkness caused by the clouds, even though it made it a bit harder to get up. i'm thankful to have hope that it won't rain too much while we're on vacation.\n\ni'm thankful that it wasn't raining yesterday when i went running and was in fact sunny. i'm thankful for the sidewalk i ran over, where someone had drawn a series of pink heart outlines, each subsequent one slightly smaller than the last, until they culminated in a very tiny one. i'm thankful to have watched a little girl biking up a steep hill with her father and, after valiantly trying to pedal, getting off and walk/running her very tiny pink bike up to the top of the hill.\n\ni'm thankful that [kim k isn't actually going to vote for donald trump](https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/779869447288913920). i'm thankful to have checked whether i was registered to vote and realized that i wasn't, though i thought i was, and so to have registered to vote. i'm thankful if you are an american to recommend that you check on your registration and/or register, because it's probably not too late but it will be soon. i'm thankful for [this service-y list of voter registration deadlines by state](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/us/politics/voter-registration-deadlines.html?_r=0). \n\ni'm thankful that i am not going to force myself to watch tonight's presidential debate live, which is not going to have any effect on who i vote for and would just stress me out for no reason. i'm thankful to remember in 2012 going over to a friend's apartment to watch one of the obama/romney debates and d and i eating too many weed cookies, which resulted in us feeling like his leather couch was quicksand we were sinking into and us being still silly stoned when we woke up the next day.\n\ni'm thankful jk rowling wrote about listening to _[violent femmes](http://ramalbumclub.com/post/150765863879/week-75-violent-femmes-by-violent-femmes)_ for the first time. i'm thankful that my harry potter house is ravenclaw, which at first i found slightly disappointing but seems appropriate. i'm thankful we watched the first episode of _pulling_, which was so hilarious, based on [the most recent issue](http://tinyletter.com/coffeeandtv/letters/coffee-tv-fleabag-blank-slate-slightly-nsfw) of [coffee and tv](http://tinyletter.com/coffeeandtv). i'm thankful for cringe comedy. i'm thankful that in the knockoff personality test our coworker had all of us take, i got the result of SIC (supportive, inspiring, cautious), which made me laugh, and am thankful for the wikipedia entry for \"[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic).\"",
