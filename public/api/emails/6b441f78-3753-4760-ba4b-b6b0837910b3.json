  "body": "i'm thankful for her sunday afternoon walk, i took miso to a place she hadn't been before, which is a large open field in front of an elementary school down the busy street our street is off of. i'm thankful that though she was nervous about the cars on the busy street and i had to carry her to the center of the field, once we got there and she loosened up, she was able to freely follow her nose wherever she wanted, since unlike on our street, where i am always acutely conscious of how deeply she is in someone's yard and pulling her out unless it's what i have deemed acceptable, she could go in mostly any direction.\n\ni'm thankful that when she got home, i was sitting on the floor reading this week's issue of _new york_ (i'm thankful for [rebecca traister](https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/rebecca-traister-good-and-mad-book-excerpt.html)) and she sniffed my crotch, which, since i was still wearing my running tights from my morning run, i'm sure smelled ripe. i'm thankful i diverted her from my crotch by pressing my legs together and i'm thankful that then, she laid down and rested in my lap, the first time she has ever done that on her own initiative and without the bribery of a treat. i'm thankful to have petted her as she laid there and that she didn't bite me, which she often does when we try to pet her. i'm thankful that though she got up when d came down the hallway to get some shoes for her business trip, i called to her and she came back and laid down again.\n\ni'm thankful that soon enough, she got up again, since i can't sit here on the floor forever, but i'm thankful for those two moments of her sitting in my lap and for the promise that they imply more in the future.",
