  "body": "i'm thankful we quit watching the movie _deadpool_ after the first twenty minutes or so (i'm thankful that it was probably a bad sign when, trying to search for the movie because we couldn't settle on anything else to watch, i kept calling it \"daredevil\" and d volunteered \"deadshot\" from which we eventually got _deadpool_). i'm thankful for how annoyed the movie's empty irony and reflexive reflexivity made me. i'm thankful that though i've never really been much of a fan of whedon or the whedonesque, i can at least admit that sometimes he's funny and that his characters usually have some measure of intelligence and heart and aren't just nihilistic quip machines. i'm thankful, since we quit watching the movie after the first twenty minutes, to not have had to listen anymore to the various strained vocal inflections and tonal quirks that the actors used to try to play their cards against humanity, which to me were the equivalent of when people immediately preemptively laugh after they say something not very funny to signal to others that it is funny. i'm thankful to prefer deadpan to _deadpool_ (i'm thankful that i love puns, so i admit i'm not speaking from a position of perfect aesthetic/moral rectitude, and if you had a good time watching _deadpool_, i'm glad for you). i'm thankful that d sensed my growing annoyance with the movie and broke the silence of not laughter by saying we didn't have to watch it anymore because she didn't like it either and thankful for how happy i was to turn it off. i'm thankful that d is such a positive person that she still found something to like in the movie, which was that the cg animation of deadpool's mask was impressively expressive and in that way really captured something from the comics.\n\ni'm thankful that instead of the rest of _deadpool_, we watched _the big short_, which is an imperfect movie but is at least a movie that wants to do something and has an interesting way of trying to do it. i'm thankful to the movie's commitment to not pulling away too far from the complexities of boring financial instruments but for its desire, at the same time, to be entertaining (which i think it mostly is, largely due to great performances and good writing). i'm thankful that rather than _deadpool_, which breaks the fourth wall as a way of glossing over the fact that it doesn't have any interesting ideas, to try to make it a \"bad movie\" (omg haha, in ironic quotation marks!) rather than just a bad movie, _the big short_ uses metacinematic techniques either to _a_) make clear the moments when the facts of the crisis are smudged in order to fit cinematic conventions (thus, ultimately, solidifying the truth claims the movie makes in other self-conscious asides to the audience (\"_i swear, this really happened_\")) or _b_) to try to jolt the viewer out of complacency, to plead that even if it's hard or boring it's important to try to understand the labyrinthine manipulations of the finance industry because a lack of popular understanding is one of the things that allows a system so insidious to persist. i'm thankful for steve carell, who, especially because of the extratextual resonance of his career-defining performance as michael scott, well-intentioned but inept businessman, provides such a perfect warm emotional center for the movie.\n\ni'm thankful

thankful for d's discovery that the oven malfunctions when we run the living room air conditioner, which is on the same circuit and probably shouldn't be (i'm thankful to have tabbed over to amazon and bought the necessary equipment to change this). i'm thankful that yesterday, during a bout of unpleasant side effects from a new supplement, i had a moment where i was imagining a

knowing how it would affect you and realized afterward that i was basically trying to invent drug dealers.",
