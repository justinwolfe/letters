  "body": "i'm thankful, always, for lazy saturday mornings in bed. i'm thankful that i haven't accidentally ripped a hole in our sheets with my heels like i always eventually do. i'm thankful for our bedroom air conditioner and thankful for the luxury of being in a cool room in bed in the summer.\n\ni'm thankful that though the last few days at work were very busy and stressful, they are over now. i'm thankful that things quieted down at the end of the day yesterday and i got to work on a project i'm really excited about. i'm thankful for when a coworker explained why variable scope was preventing javascript that should have been working from working.\n\ni'm thankful that i inherited d's old 3ds after i bought her a new one for her birthday. i'm thankful for the game i have been playing, _art academy: lessons for everyone_, in which a small cartoon man teaches you artistic techniques which you deploy using the 3ds stylus. i'm thankful for the double screen of the 3ds, which allows you to really easily use a grid to get the proportions of the thing you're drawing. i'm thankful for the painting of a cherry i made for the first lesson.\n\ni'm thankful for how entertaining reading _caliban's war_ has been, even though now, halfway through it, my eyes are wandering toward other things i want to read. i'm thankful that this book doesn't have the noir overtones of the first and is instead full-on space opera. i'm thankful for the more diverse range of characters and ideas in this book.\n\ni'm thankful to have still been thinking about jon caramanica's provocative tweet, \"[FRANK OCEAN = FIONA APPLE](https://twitter.com/joncaramanica/status/222561875097948160).\" i'm thankful to d for always finding my glasses when i lose them, though i would also pay for [this service](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/761712860145651712). i'm thankful for the mango popsicle i found in the freezer.",
