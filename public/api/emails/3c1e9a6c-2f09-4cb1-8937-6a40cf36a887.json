I cycled aimlessly in the direction of the nursery, it was late afternoon. The forsythias were in bloom in a few small front gardens. I was soon too hot in my jumper. I stopped to take it off, then carried on in my T-shirt. A smell of seaweed and salt water hung over the fields, they must have been out fertilizing. There was a song in my head for a confirmation party. I tried to think of a rhyme for pony, but all I could come up with was stony, phony, bony. The road passed through a little wood. I felt a chill on my arms as I passed through the shade, but then I came out the other side and into the warm air again. I stopped by a solitary tree at the side of the road and folded my jumper tighter on the pannier rack. The sun was very bright. I closed my eyes and turned my face upwards, and stood there for a while. I could hear myself breathing, everything turned red behind my eyelids. The bird we called the bicycle pump chirped somewhere close by, further away I heard the noise of a tractor. I thought: Here I am with only myself. Apart from the sun and the tractor and the bicycle pump. There was a warm breeze against my skin and my trainers fitted my feet just right, I'd never noticed before. A car approached and I let it go by, my eyes still closed. I wiggled my toes. I stretched my fingers out from the handlebars. By the time I opened my eyes all my thoughts had left me. I got on the bike again and carried slowly on, empty and content. At the nursery I turned down the gravel track, I walked the last bit and leaned the bike against some stacked-up sacks of peat. Lars was in the evergreens behind the goats, I could see his anorak. I looked at the hardy perennials, the grasses and the cactuses, and read all the names. Then I went down to join him, he turned round with a smile, pulled off his glove and gave me his warm, dry hand. He showed me a mahonia shrub, it was a different thing altogether from the tree variety. It was in bloom, with fragrant yellow flowers. We talked for a while. He walked me back to my bike and all the way up the gravel track, where we talked some more_.\"\n\ni'm thankful for the soothing lull of her narrative style, for the feeling of [being a body](http://genius.com/Grimes-be-a-body-lyrics) (i'm thankful to have learned a little bit this morning about the concept of [wabi-sabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi) and for how that interacts with what i was reading about last night in [a book](http://www.amazon.com/25-Lessons-Mindfulness-Healthy-Living/dp/1433813238) on mindfulness about the buddhist distinction between pain (inevitable) and suffering (not)). i'm thankful for how the feel of helle helle's book and [this review](http://electricliterature.com/this-has-been-written-in-front-of-us-on-helle-helles-first-novel-to-be-released-in-the-us/) that made me decide to buy it (i'm thankful for book reviews) reminded me of ben lerner's description of the druggy-ness of knausgaard's attention to detail [in the LRB](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n10/ben-lerner/each-cornflake) and how \"_most critics attempt to demonstrate a novelist’s perceptiveness by providing examples of his eye for the significant detail. But part of what makes Knausgaard’s writing unusual is that he seems barely to adjudicate significance; he’s like a child who has taken Henry James’s injunction to novelists – ‘be one of the people on whom nothing is lost’ – literally; he appears to just write down everything he can recall (and he appears to recall everything).\"_ i'm thankful for the passage from baudelaire lerner quotes to highlight \"the unusually equal weighting of experience that evokes both childhood and drugs\": \"_\\[Genius\\] is no more than childhood recaptured at will, childhood equipped now with man’s physical means to express itself, and with the analytical mind that enables it to bring order into the sum of experience, involuntarily amassed.
