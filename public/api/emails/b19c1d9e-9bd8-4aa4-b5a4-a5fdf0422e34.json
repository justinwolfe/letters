  "body": "i'm thankful that i only had to wait like an hour and a half at the DMV yesterday to finally get my oregon ID. i'm thankful that i had the privilege of a day where i didn't have to work so i could go handle that and do my waiting without having to worry about getting back to work. i'm thankful, even though i could have done this after starting my job anyway because i am a privileged knowledge worker, to have gone ahead and done it so i wouldn't put it off forever which i definitely might have.\n\ni'm thankful for the mobile game _void tyrant_, which i played on my phone while waiting and which, while it's less strategic and more chance based than my beloved _slay the spire,_ still hits some of that simple interface roguelite sweet spot (i'm also thankful that _slay the spire'_s mobile version is in its final QA stage and should come out soon).\n\ni'm thankful for the employees at the DMV who appreciated that i was prepared and who were efficient, kind, and helpful. i'm thankful to know how hard it can be in a high volume customer service position with lots of disgruntled customers to hit those grace notes, and so to appreciate it even more\n\ni'm thankful that it was 60 degrees yesterday and there was only the briefest hint of rain, which made for a comfortable bike ride to the DMV. i'm thankful for my bike, which is light and comfortable. i'm thankful for the extra exercise added to my day, which is always a good thing. i'm thankful for the long north south streets here which i can use to get from our neighborhood up north to everywhere else and have thick and comfortable bike lanes. i'm thankful for the variety of environments, built and natural, that i can experience on a relatively short trip.\n\ni'm thankful for the street cart tacos i got near the DMV after getting my temporary ID, since even though there was nothing notable about them, they were warm and filling and hit the spot. i'm thankful that though the cart was embedded in a pod and there was no seating, i found a defunct cart on the other side of the parking lot with an open railing to eat from. i'm thankful that though it started to sprinkle a little while i was eating, it never really rained. \n\ni'm thankful for this recipe for meatballs in a coconut milk broth i made last night (\n\n[https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020631-thai-inspired-chicken-meatball-soup](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020631-thai-inspired-chicken-meatball-soup)) was, on a base level, edible and relatively satisfying over a bowl of rice, even though i probably wouldn't make it again because a) the meatballs did not hold together well, so i ended up just breaking them down into a hash (which was fine, but different than what we were expecting and b) the flavors just weren't that interesting or powerful, which makes sense and was something i was kind of anticipating based on the ingredient list but i hoped the sum would be more than the parts and c) i added too much fish sauce in a last minute desperate drive to add flavor. \n\ni'm thankful, having had to grate a lot of ginger, to have been reminded of how much better it is too freeze the ginger first. i'm thankful for our dutch oven and for wooden spoons and for ladles.\n\ni'm thankful that _the magicians_ is back and is as good as ever. i'm thankful that last night we finished watching _the good place_, which was moving, even though SPOILER ALERT i really have trouble identifying with the idea of once and for all being \"done\" with heaven even if i get the concept intellectually.\n\ni'm thankful that though i have to pack for my onboarding trip to boston tomorrow, i'll get that done with and it won't take me that long. i'm thankful that we have a washer and dryer and i'm thankful that they're in our basement, even if it's sometimes annoying to ferry loads back and forth and up and down. i'm thankful for the feeling of clothes warm from the dryer.  \n\ni'm thankful to have found a new way to get miso to hold still while i dry her off from being out in our wet muddy backyard, which is to take a treat out of the bag and put it on the corner of my standing desk, visible but out of her reach, which distracts her as i vigorously towel her.",
