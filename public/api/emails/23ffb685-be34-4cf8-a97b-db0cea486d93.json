high-concept formally playful sci-fi with rich world-building that also really hits on the sentence and character level (a rare jewel) and the style of the narration from the AI (/its \"characterization\") rings against and rhymes with the current chatbot experience in interesting ways). recommended especially if you liked [_the ministry for the future_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50998056) or [_aurora_](https://www.amazon.com/Aurora-Kim-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0316098094) or [_station eleven_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/20170404) (which we still need to go back and watch the TV show for).\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/324.jpg) \n\nthe [Suno AI](https://app.suno.ai/) app, which is the most fun you will have with AI today (if you are person who has fun with AI—i understand if you aren't, but i am!). it's a  music generator that in terms of the coherence and quality of its output (you can either give it a prompt or provide lyrics and a description of the sound) is head and shoulders above anything i've ever seen, a step change. i'm thankful, as someone whose \"thing\" at work is making novelty songs for my coworkers, to feel threatened but also (as with most AI things that in some way might threaten me and my future ([see also](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/))), i also can't help myself from being amazed at the magic and wanting to play with it.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/325.jpg) \n\non saturday we were all up in the attic taking turns sharing our tiktok feeds with each other and in my feed, which heavily features skateboarding videos, classic/alt rock/indie live performances, and competitive eating, an early seventies live video of wings playing [\"live and let die\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh-TC7w8vrU) showed up and t asked k who the band was (knowing she wouldn't know) and k said, gamely (but totally unsure), \"_...audioslave?_\" and t and i laughed very hard. then k telling me yesterday that this has spawned a new bit in their household where anytime any music comes on, k asks t if it's audioslave.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/328.jpg) \n\nwatching _the real world: homecoming, new orleans_ (rental, amazon video) after (as recently mentioned) rewatching _the real world: new orleans_ (streaming on netflix and paramount+, rental on amazon video), which i thought was going to just be boring and soft because of their age but there is still tons of drama and it's fascinating!
