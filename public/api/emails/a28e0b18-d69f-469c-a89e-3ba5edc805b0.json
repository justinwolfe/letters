  "body": "i'm thankful that though i slept too late this morning to go running or to write much here, i let my body sleep since i think it needed it. i'm thankful that the bed in this hotel is very comfortable and the room is dark and cool. i'm thankful that i had fun hanging out with friends last night. i'm thankful that the project team i'm on is full of smart people who want to do a good job, but i'm thankful that i think we're also not going to run ourselves into the ground. i'm thankful that i think i helped reassure a coworker who was feeling stressed and inadequate. i'm thankful that we played a company trivia game last night and though i made absolutely no contribution to my team, it was stacked with winners and we still won. i'm thankful that the people who planned the retreat rented instruments to play with and we got to jam a little last night. i'm thankful that though i'm not normally a huge creme brulee fan, i had a good one. i'm thankful that i have been drinking a moderate amount of alcohol and it has not seemed to have had an adverse effect on my stomach. i'm thankful that there is wifi outside and the weather has been perfect. i'm thankful for a nice email that i got from d and that i was able to facetime with her a bit after dinner last night. i'm thankful to have had another good day but also thankful that this means i am a day closer to going home. i'm thankful for how fast time moves here.",
