  "body": "i'm thankful that the problems that seemed so impossible on monday night weren't so bad on tuesday morning. i'm thankful that one customer resolved her own issue and that a coworker helped me resolve the other quickly and without undue stress. i'm thankful that though things were busy in the morning, i was eventually able to get out from under the tickets piled around me. i'm thankful that my coworker who had sent me stressed complaints about the tool i restructured yesterday dmed me at the end of the day to tell me how she was getting used to it and thought that it would be good and useful in the long run. i'm thankful that i learned how to access and modify the xml our app generates through the console. i'm thankful for jquery. i'm thankful for tampermonkey. \n\ni'm thankful that i thought i had spoken too soon and jinxed myself about the mr. grip stuff yesterday, since, under the pressure of opening and closing the door some more, the screws came loose again. i'm thankful to have found this funny rather than frustrating. i'm thankful to have unscrewed the screws, added more of the mr. grip stuff into the holes (because i think i might not have added enough the first time) and then screwed the screws back in. i'm thankful that it seems to be holding and thankful to hope that it continues to do so.\n\ni'm thankful for the _pop ambient_ compilations, especially _pop ambient 2002_ and _2006_. i'm thankful that they are great meditation music if you are looking for that, thankful that they eschew the gaudy new age orientalist tropes of most music explicitly designed for meditation. i'm thankful that they both provide enough novelty and sonic richness that i can pay attention to them to try to keep my mind from wandering but also enough space to not be musically distracting. i'm thankful for the album _woman_ by rhye, which i know has a sade-biting pbr&b reputation, but i'm thankful still for how beautifully written and arranged and sung the music is and thankful to have happily listened to it many times with d and to be listening to it right now.\n\ni'm thankful for the most recent episode of _vice principals_, which made me laugh/cringe so hard that on multiple occasions i had to look away from the screen and bury my face in d's bosom. i'm thankful for d's bosom. i'm thankful that to entertain her once while feeling silly i improvised an infomercial for the \"real feel bosom buddy,\" a chest shaped pillow filled with silicone. i'm thankful that the other day she got a blackberry seed stuck in one of her teeth and asked me for one of the tea tree oil toothpicks i keep to feed my oral fixation and thankful to have made her erupt in giggles by offering instead to suck the seed out of her mouth.\n\ni'm thankful that kanye puts two dollar bills in kim's drawers to lend her luck. i'm thankful for nice emails with friends. i'm thankful for [this photo of miles davis and james baldwin](https://twitter.com/natechinen/status/628027327046414340). i'm thankful for the proto-ambient opening part of _in a silent way_, which i think is so beautiful, though i don't like the other part as much (or at least didn't last time i listened: i'm thankful that our tastes can change over time and thankful to get the opportunity to test whether mine have). i'm thankful for [this mesmerizing video of parking directions being poured onto asphalt](https://twitter.com/mattround/status/760384985526304768).",
