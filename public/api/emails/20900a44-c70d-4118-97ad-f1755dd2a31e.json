  "body": "i'm thankful that last night in bed d was surprised by the sudden smell of oranges, which i at first lied and told her was because i had been eating a lot of oranges but then revealed was because i had put orange essential oil into the diffuser by our bed. i'm thankful for the nice fresh smell of citrus. i'm thankful that it reminded d of some disneyland/disneyworld ride she wasn't sure she had ridden but remembered as having a scene where you fly over a grove of oranges and they pump the smell in. i'm thankful to have remembered riding the king kong ride at universal studios as a child and how my dad and i were impressed by the banana smell they'd engineered for us to smell when king kong roared at us. \n\ni'm thankful that [my dad and i still have similar interests](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/828807654080380929). i'm thankful that my parents sent us a box of very juicy florida oranges, even though we are already pretty well stocked for oranges. i'm thankful to have bit the top off of one of the oranges and kissed d and while kissing started to push the top of the orange into her mouth with my tongue as a rude surprise. i'm thankful for how long and intensely the bitterness of the orange peel lingered in my mouth and for what an interesting taste it is. i'm thankful for john mcphee's _[oranges](https://www.amazon.com/Oranges-John-McPhee-ebook/dp/B005E8AN0A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1486557618&sr=1-1&keywords=john+mcphee+oranges)_, which i never finished i don't think but which i enjoyed while reading it. i'm thankful that [i am no longer in an mfa program](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/828808752572809216).\n\ni'm thankful to have had my exit interview with our ceo and i'm thankful that i think the conversation was productive and will hopefully help my team be happier once i'm gone. i'm thankful he seemed to be hearing me when i described the intensity of the problems facing my team and the causes and exacerbating factors for that intensity, which i think he had some awareness of but not as much as i think is necessary. i'm thankful that i think i convinced him to have 1-1 meetings with the rest of my team. i'm thankful he asked me about what i thought about d's changing role at the company, even though it was kind of inappropriate, because i was able to describe how impressed i've been by her recent work and how happy it seems to make her to be making a bigger difference to the product. i'm thankful that this week, i have to do live chat for 5 hours a day instead of the normal 3 hours, which is a long time and draining but i'm thankful that i know i'll get through it and then i'll be done. i'm thankful the extended shift means i get to work chat with one of my favorite coworkers and i'm thankful that when i sent her a gif after she snatched a chat before i could get to it, she said \"you make work fun,\" which is what i want to hear. \n\ni'm thankful for [national treasure chelsea peretti](https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/829000619063013376), my favorite comedian. i'm thankful for her comfort with discomfort. i'm thankful that we had stopped watching _terrace house_ for a while but came to it yesterday in the absence of a light half hour show to watch during dinner and were pleasantly surprised by a sudden shakeup and intensely meta twist that changed everything. i'm thankful for the new character and for the small drama of his not taking off his shoes the first time he entered the house. i'm thankful for the long conversation the characters had about having trouble ordering soba while drunk. i'm thankful for the strangeness of the show, which unlike most reality shows is airing as it's being shot, yet the characters aren't isolated from the outside world as they are in, say, _big brother_, such that people the characters interact with in the world know their stories from the show and can interact with them about it. i'm thankful for a very sad scene where a character cried beautiful tears after being rejected. i'm thankful for d and i's conversation about the intimacy of being a hairstylist.\n\ni'm thankful for \"[lost in my bedroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTJ2XkX7YRQ)\" by sky ferreira. i'm thankful for _multi-love_ by unknown mortal orchestra, which i didn't really like when i tried listening to it when it first came out but which i'm getting into now. i'm thankful for _the solo sessions, volume 1_, by bill evans, which is my favorite meditation music. i'm thankful for the new bass multi-effect pedal i bought, which has some really cool sounds. i'm thankful for [this metafilter post about chinese science fiction](http://www.metafilter.com/164976/Weakness-and-ignorance-are-not-barriers-to-survival-but-arrogance-is). i'm thankful for two octavia butler books that i haven't read that are on sale for a
