  "body": "i'm thankful for the nice conversation i had with mom and dad last night on the occasion of dad's birthday. i'm thankful that even though the phone was dropping out during my call with mom because her cell booster was on the fritz, we were able to have a nice conversation. i'm grateful that even though dad had a shitty day, he was able to feel better and enjoy some of his birthday evening. i'm thankful that even though the viewmaster vr viewer thing i bought him did not work properly, there were apps in the app store for him to play with. i'm thankful that the fancy monster-shaped chocolates d sent arrived on his birthday so he had something to open, and i'm grateful that even though the chocolates melted in transit, they were still delicious.\n\ni'm thankful for the discovery that my struggles to keep up with other bikers and the occasional knee pain i experienced were not (or at least, not completely) because i’m not good at biking, but because my bike seat was set too low. i'm thankful to have learned from a magazine's website that if you can touch the ground with both feet while straddling your bike seat, the seat is set too low. i'm thankful that i didn't need any tools to reset the seat after work yesterday, that all i needed to do was unclamp it and pull it up a bit higher, and i'm thankful for the way i glided home. i'm thankful that this experience continues to be so rewarding, and thankful that i've finally picked it up again after so many years.\n\ni'm thankful that even though i left the roasted root vegetables i was reheating in the oven for too long, because i was distracted by my conversation with mom, they still tasted good and, in fact, maybe even tasted better. i’m thankful for carrots and broccoli and cauliflower and brussels sprouts. i'm thankful that i was able to save them at the last minute from burning. i'm thankful for mediocre fish farm cod, which is probably really bad for me and the world. i'm thankful for the doenjang i plopped onto the top of the filets before I sealed the pyrex dish as a hail mary flavoring idea, even if it did not melt as i had hoped and was a bit too salty. i'm thankful that my doctor called in sick an hour before our appointment this morning, because i did not particularly want to go to the doctor, and i’m thankful that i’m in good enough health that it doesn't matter that this appointment had to be rescheduled, and i’m thankful that i have good insurance and am able to go to the doctor when necessary. i'm thankful for [redacted]. i'm thankful that my meeting at work this morning went well and that i went all day yesterday without feeling depressed or irritated at all. i'm thankful that even though my brother started smoking again, which is sad, he wants to stop, which is something to be thankful for. i'm thankful that i could wear short sleeves and no jacket and i'm grateful for the weather today, what may be the last warm day of the year.",
