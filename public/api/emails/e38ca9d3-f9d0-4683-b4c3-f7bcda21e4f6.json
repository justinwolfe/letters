  "body": "i'm thankful that i rolled our burritos well last night. i'm thankful for avocado and thankful for lime juice and thankful for salt. i'm thankful salsa verde and i'm thankful for hot sauce. i'm thankful for microwaves and aluminum foil (though thankful to have learned at a young age not to combine the two). i'm thankful for the old milk chocolate bar that i found in the cupboard. i'm thankful for how much refreshing fruit there is in a watermelon. i'm thankful for honey squeezed into iced tea and thankful that i'll make syrup today so that it blends better. \n\ni'm thankful for \"[i say a little prayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtBbyglq37E)\" by aretha franklin. i'm thankful for the call and response backing vocals. i'm thankful for when they go high and sing \"_believe me_\" and \"_answer my prayer_\" at the end of the song. i'm thankful for the way her voice twists and runs into the ragged edge of the road before swerving back into the tonal center. i'm thankful for the way the snare drum kicks into overdrive at the start of the chorus. i'm thankful for the rhyme of \"_at work i just take time / and all through my coffee break time_.\"\n\ni'm thankful that work went pretty well yesterday. i'm thankful to knock on wood as i write this sentence, since the week is not over yet, but thankful that it feels like this week wasn't quite as hard as last week was. i'm really thankful for that. i'm thankful to imagine that maybe next week might be slightly easier. i'm thankful that last night assembling our burritos was the first time i felt happy to be pulling dinner together, where it gave me a bit of the kind of joy i used to get when i got home from the office, that sense of a transition away from work. i'm thankful to have gotten my first full paycheck from the new job. \n\ni'm thankful that hillary clinton is the democratic candidate for president. i'm thankful to get to witness how moved some women are by her candidacy but thankful also for women who aren't so moved, which is their prerogative even if i might disagree with them. i'm thankful for humanizing memes and social shares. i'm thankful for balloons and confetti and celebratory fanfare, event though the combination of them sometimes reflects a national pride that i don't feel. i'm thankful, though i have never really liked katy perry, for katy perry.\n\ni'm thankful that we can't stop and thankful that we won't stop. i'm thankful for [this mashup of \"do not go gentle into the good night\" and \"we can't stop](https://cassandragillig.bandcamp.com/track/do-not-cant-stop-into-that-good-night).\" i'm thankful for britney's wonderfully terrible faux-british accent on \"work b\\*\\*ch.\" i'm thankful for silliness, which is an important mechanism for self care. i'm thankful for [other modes of self care](https://twitter.com/cosmopsis/status/758791801750876160). i'm thankful that i cleaned the kitchen on my lunch break yesterday so i don't have to do it today. i'm thankful that it's friday and it's not suppose to quite so hot this weekend.",
