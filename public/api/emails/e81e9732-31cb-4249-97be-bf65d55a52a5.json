  "body": "i'm thankful to have mowed the lawn at our new house for the first time yesterday before lunch. i'm thankful that it's a mower that you start by pulling a cord vigorously several times. i'm thankful that when i was a kid i somehow got a subscription to _boy's life_ magazine (which was the only thing that made me interested in being a boy scout, having a subscription to this magazine) and in the back of it there were ads and i would always fantasize about the ones that involved using a lawnmower motor to build a go cart. i'm thankful for how magical it seemed to me that part of this boring utilitarian device could be used to make the children's version of a car.\n\ni'm thankful that the yard of the house is pretty small, so it didn't take me that long. i'm thankful that though i ran over a few rocks that i didn't see they didn't cause any damage and i'm thankful that i didn't run over the orange wire that makes our internet work and that the cable company haven't buried yet, though i did run over a couple of the little flags in the yard indicating where it should be buried. i'm thankful for the back yard, where the grass was thickest and so cutting it was the most satisfying. i'm thankful for the clumps of shredded turf left in my wake. i'm thankful to cut long straight lines and then cross them with more long straight lines, a combination that blends and disappears both sets of lines.\n\ni'm thankful that mowing was the longest time i've spent in our back yard since we moved and am thankful that in doing so i discovered what a nice place the back yard is and that i should spend more time there before it gets too cold. i'm thankful to know that though fall still feels far away, it will come soon. i'm thankful to be looking forward to that. i'm thankful that this house has a fireplace, which is something i've never had in a house i've lived in, and i'm thankful that while the center of our living room is always going to be the television, it might still be nice to have a fire. i'm thankful our landlords came by and fixed a problem with the electrical outlets in the garage.\n\ni'm thankful that though both d and i have been feeling off lately and our relationship has been a bit detached, we're hanging in there. i'm thankful to hope that the changes in our respective medications work out (i'm thankful to hope that my doctor's office calls in my prescription renewal today so that i don't have to worry about that and call them stressed out tomorrow). i'm thankful for the organizer box that she bought me for my supplements, which i filled for the first time last night and which i think will be great. i'm thankful that though i have had a flare up of what i think is plantar fasciitis, running on the treadmill instead of outside seems to be helping. i'm thankful to force myself to do stretches for it even when i'm not in the mood to do them.",
