  "body": "i'm thankful that (fingers crossed) my new medication seems to be helping—i'm thankful that i can feel it in the evening when it wears off, which, though that's not ideal, helps bring into relief the relief it is bringing me into earlier in the day. i'm thankful that i haven't spent my workdays this week beating myself up or feeling inadequate or doing the technical support equivalent of running around like a chicken with its head cut off. i'm thankful to have been able to push back the start of my day by a half hour to ensure i have time to do yoga before work, which is a habit i had gotten out of because i didn't have enough time in the morning for this and that and everything else.\n\ni'm thankful that, in addition to the medication, i've been getting extra time to work on a project i'm excited about this week. i'm thankful that each time i've hit some technical problem in the project, i've been able to find a way around or through it. i'm thankful to have been sharing my progress through bloggy comments on my pull requests, which serve as both a record of my labor and an explanation of how/why i chose to handle a particular problem a particular way. i'm thankful that i am already looking forward to the part of the day today where i get to continue my work on it, whereas last week i wasn't looking forward to anything at all. \n\ni'm thankful that i convinced one of my coworkers to watch terrace house and he said that in his enjoyment of it, he realized \"_reality tv had been missing from his life_\" which i found moving (i'm thankful i found this out because i had DMed him to tell him how much i appreciated [these _westworld_ explainer videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn6yDpEottdhgybg5s39zNxRxBVKenlp6) he had recommended to me). i'm thankful for another coworker who shared a picture of the two of us, in the mosaic of a hundred animated webcam tiles during a video meeting, making the exact same expression.",
