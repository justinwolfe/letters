(i don't really do much restriction but i'm aware that too much pizza or especially too much fried food can kind of guarantee mild issues (i try not to overeat these things and to listen to my body, but i do eat them regularly because i love them); beans are also a risky proposition (but i don't really like them so i don't mind).\n\nin terms of over the counter medication, the one that i found most effective and least disruptive in terms of side effects was famotidine; it provided relatively quick relief and seemed to last longer. for more immediate action i think the tums tropical fruit calcium supplements are the most palatable version (they also have a formulation called meltaways which i remember being fine now). proton pump inhibiter medications like nexium/prilosec/prevacid are supposedly some of the most effective in terms of scientific study, but i found they really fucked with my body in terms of side effects and didn't seem to actually help (and the research on them has highlighted some potential problems). if you end up taking some form of calcium (i.e. tums or another supplement), in my experience it may be important to balance that out with magnesium, both for physical and mental health\n\n(and also, try to not try a million things at once so you can see the impact of changing individual variables, but when you feel bad and you have the option it's sometimes hard to resist the kitchen sink approach)\n\nhope this helps\"\n\ni'm thankful that i do not have to think about this particular body problem much anymore\n\nOn Sat, Jan 9, 2021 at 10:58 AM Justin Wolfe <[justin.wolfe@gmail.com](mailto:justin.wolfe@gmail.com)\\> wrote:\n\n> zing it as a sign of something worse because the inflammation from that stress just feeds it and makes it worse\n>\n> if you're a fast eater (i'm an extremely fast eater) slowing down or trying to chew more is good if you can make yourself do it (i'm not very good at that, but i try to try). keeping a food diary can be good if you think specific food triggers you more.
