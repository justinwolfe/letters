  "body": "i'm thankful that this morning at 8am when my mom texted me from thailand about what would be a good time to call, i said i could do it then. i'm thankful that though i did not particularly want to have a phone call at 8am on a sunday morning, i did it anyway because i know that it's important to my parents to talk to me and it's important for me to talk to them (even though i don't think i feel the intensity of that importance in the same way they do, and maybe never will) and if i didn't do it then, it would be easier not to do it at all. i'm thankful that for most of my adulthood, i have been a diligent parent caller, which i know is reassuring to them, and was someone who would initiate the calls as much as i would receive them, and have only really slacked off since my parents have been on this trip that makes their schedule and time zone difficult to predict and/or incongruous to the times when i am in the mood to drag myself onto a phone call. i'm thankful that they are having a good time and i'm thankful they were able to tell me about it; i'm thankful that, on my end, there was little to report.",
