  "body": "I'm thankful for lemon cookies, and the happiness they bring me when I make them, and the happiness they can bring others. I'm thankful that I have others in my life who appreciate my lemon cookies.\n\nI'm thankful that I have been sad recently, because this is one of the first times in my life when I have really been sad for an extended period of time (I'm pretty young). I'm thankful that this period of sadness has broken my bubble of innocence and naivety to an extent, and that my melancholy is teaching me to push through hard times and find the small joys of life. I'm thankful that I have several very close friends who are willing to talk me through bad days, even though they live hours away from me and have their own struggles going on. I'm thankful for friends in general. Moving states has taught me how hard it is to make friends, and how valuable they really are.\n\nI'm thankful for toddlers and how tiring they are. Nothing is easy with them, and they need rational for everything you tell them to do, if they even listen at all. I'm thankful that babysitting a 2-year-old makes me think about the reasons for my actions- when the kid asks \"Why?\" I don't always have an answer, and it seems like much of civilized adult life doesn't have a concrete reason behind it.\n\nI'm thankful for thank you notes, because they make me feel like I have a friend telling me about his day, and they remind me that life is good even when it's hard and sad. They keep me optimistic. And I'm thankful for everyone reading this.\n\n\\- Zoe (01/02/2017).",
