  "body": "I am thankful for the opportunity to be thankful. I am thankful that my son who, when he was younger, saw no point in literature now is an English major and wants to be a writer. I am thankful that my daughter has exquisite empathy for all living things. I am thankful that my husband stays with me, in spite of the fact that I am probably very unpleasant to live with. I am thankful for books and theatre and music. I am thankful for art, especially when you consider it a verb. I am thankful for grape soda, which I shouldn't drink, but it tastes so good. I am thankful for all of the people in the world who understand that pain, physical and emotional, can render one hopeless. And I am thankful that some who understand this are not afraid to be with me until the pain lifts just enough to slide out from under it.\n\n\\- Zilla (5/19/16). I exist in the shadows of the world.",
