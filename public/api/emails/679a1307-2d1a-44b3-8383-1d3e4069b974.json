and all the roommates saw it!! she admits to having made out with her female roommate, i think because in her weird moral ~~calculus~~ (arithmetic, she's too dumb for calculus (i am also too dumb for calculus)) that's less of a betrayal because she's not a lesbian), which makes dylan feel gaslit and hurt. \n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/226.jpg) \n\nthis storyline gets deferred briefly for the b-story, which is jenna and another roommate sabrina in the studio recording an original song (one of their \"go big\" challenges) and the song is terrible but its existence and it being played once during the 7:00 drive time radio hour for a vacation in las vegas is apparently for both of them the culmination of their entire life's work. afterward, jenna, though clearly destabilized by seeing the possibility of a good relationship with dylan, makes up with austin over email, which she tells sabrina, disappointing her. another b-story which follows is the episode's obligatory extreme sport segment where they do offroad driving in the desert and where dylan and jenna share a car and seem to regroup a bit (unclear, but it doesn't seem as though jenna has told him anything definitive about whether she's staying with her boyfriend).\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/227.jpg) \n\nafterward everyone is hanging out in the house on a high after the off-roading and jenna is doing some playful wrestling with dylan and then, making a \"joke\", reveals that she was physically abused in a past relationship and has not really processed it and everyone is troubled by this and supportive of jenna even though even in this conversation where they feel love and support she is also being frustrating enough in how she talks about things that they have to raise their voices with her. we listen to the roommates listening to jenna and sabrina's song, which is a churchy piano ballad, and especially in light of the abuse relevation, they seem moved—ceejai, a Black law student whose father shot her mother and was then killed by police and who has previously had blow-ups with jenna about offensive things she's said, is particularly touched.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/228.jpg) \n\ndylan and jenna seem to have made up, in that she's not rebuffing his affection, and his take at this point is, while hurt by her lying about having made up with him and knowing that she hasn't broken up with her boyfriend, that she still seems to really like him and maybe he just needs to continue to be affectionate to her but then they go into the confessional together and she pushes him away when he tries to kiss her which he takes as a pretty clear signal she doesn't want him and so leaves the confessional, telling the other roommates he's giving up because it's so frustrating. everyone goes out to drink heavily again and once drinking dylan and jenna seem to attract each other again but then on the dance floor she blocks another kiss and he is embarrassed and basically tells her he genuinely likes her and wants to be with her gives her an ultimatum, which she rejects. \n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/224.jpg) \n\nthe roommates go back to their hotel to drink more and dylan goes downstairs to the lobby area with a couple of other roommates to vent and tells them that he is officially done, that it's not worth it (the roommate attitude toward this budding romance has been encouragement, but also they already clearly like dylan, a person who has been on the show for two days at this point, much better than jenna and are annoyed by the possibility of her stringing him along fucking up his experience). upstairs, jenna is talking about this with other roommates and they convince her that dylan is what she wants and she can't let fear hold her back, so she sends an email to austin breaking up with him and then goes downstairs and pulls dylan aside and tells him that she wants to be with him.\n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/230.jpg) \n\nbut he says no, that he can't trust whatever she says because already she's lied to him and even if she says she wants him now she'll just want to be with austin tomorrow, so why should he let himself get hurt. it's clear that this is _not_ the reaction she was expecting (or, tbh, that i as the viewer was expecting) and she tries to disagree and make herself more vulnerable but he coldly shuts things down and she walks away by herself and despite disliking her so deeply for the entire season i almost kind of a tiny bit feel something for her (it is a very powerful human moment! this is what i watch reality TV for!). the next day, jenna reveals to another roommate while doing her hair that she told dylan she wanted to be with him and that he denied her but she still thinks there's some ambiguity and she has a chance. \n\n ![image.png](/letters/images/229.jpg) \n\nthat night some of the roommates go to a country bar (jenna on country music: \"it makes me wanna have sex\") and jenna pouts and complains to dylan that he's not paying enough attention to her, which he is annoyed by because he thought it was clear that they were done. he starts to chat up another girl and she gets all in his space and is territorial. eventually, they come back to the house, where the other roommates have built a large blanket fort in the living room. dylan sits at the kitchen counter eating a wrap from subway and jenna once again drunkenly tries to get him to be affectionate with her, but he says the door is closed. On the other side of the living room there is playful fighting among the other roommates about who gets to be inside the blanket fort. dylan goes over to hang out and jenna from a distance keeps calling his name which is increasingly annoying to the other roommates, who start to yell at her, which spawns a screaming match between jenna and ceejai that culminates in jenna coming over and pushing ceejai and the two of them wrestling before they are separated by producers. after a cooling off period, jenna is allowed back into the apartment and ceejai vents to the other roommates about how hard her life has been, how much she has lost, wondering if she is going to lose this opportunity and be sent home for fighting someone she doesn't even care about and that's where the episode ends (there are two more left in the season).\n\n## Previously on this day:\n\n- [2016](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/thank-you-notes-612/) (_saw a doe in the yard while washing dishes_)\n- [2017](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/61217/) (_so much good new music, special jolly ranchers, to have beaten my second divine beast in breath of the wild_)\n- [2018](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/x/) (from **x**) (_train delays, shopping lists, cats_)\n- [2019](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/511/) (_\"nice conversation encouraging smart coworker to believe in herself, cheesecake for dessert, lightning bugs\"_)\n- [2022](https://buttondown.email/justinwolfe/archive/instagram-picture/) (_instagram picture of ruth glowing in a mazzy star t-shirt against pastel clouds_)",
