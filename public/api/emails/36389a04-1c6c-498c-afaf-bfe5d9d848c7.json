  "body": "i'm thankful that we're trying a new strategy at work this week in the hope of reducing everyone's stress levels. i'm thankful to be trying the new strategy, even if i don't know if it will actually work, since it's better to try new things that might fail but might also help than to continue to suffer from the status quo. i'm thankful for the possibility that today might be easier than yesterday. i'm thankful that even though it was busy yesterday, i made time to take a lunch break, which i should always do.\n\ni'm thankful that my new iphone came in the meal earlier than expected. i'm thankful for my new iphone, which is big and pretty. i'm thankful that i didn't really need a new iphone, even though there were problems with my old iphone, but thankful that i let myself get a new iphone anymore. i'm thankful to know that i am spending more than i used to and more than i probably should. i'm thankful to know that it is a trap to spend more when you get a job that pays more, where you get locked into working harder to make more money to pay for the conveniences that make it possible/worthwhile for you to work harder. i'm thankful, on the other hand, to be able to use some of my new disposable income on things that make the texture of my life feel easier/better.\n\ni'm thankful that though our dishwasher isn't working, i washed all the glasses we own and left them to dry on a towel on the countertop. i'm thankful for hot water and thankful for dish soap. i'm thankful for the serrated knife i use to cut tomatoes and, because i didn't want to wash another knife last night, even though i know it's not \"correct,\" used to cut an onion. i'm thankful to have read a summary of the presidential debate in the newspaper and watched a short video montage of it rather than watching the whole thing live. i'm thankful that i didn't read twitter last night.",
