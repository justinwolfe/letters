  "body": "I'm thankful for the leftover daal in my freezer, the recipe which I finally managed to perfect last week. I'm thankful for bags of baby spinach and whole cloves of garlic and the gigantic salted caramel cheesecake my dad found and then shared with me when he went shopping at a new grocery store.\n\nMy dad, who has tacitly made me more understanding of the men in my life and the men I work with by being polite and kind, to the point where new people will comment on these things about him in pleasant surprise. For my good regulars who are generous and always happy to be near me. I'm even thankful for the awful clients, who see the money they put down as an entitlement to me as opposed to my time. I'm thankful that they enable me to compartmentalize and enjoy my time with my good clients more than I already do.\n\nI'm thankful for the \"\"hard fun\"\" of ethical non monogamy. For my partner R, who is calm, understanding and endlessly accepting. Who, when I told him he has a pretty mouth, asked me to buy another tube of the lip balm I use. I'm thankful for someone who wakes up at five with me so we can go to the gym. Who watches the sunrise on the drive there and almost always comments on it. I'm thankful that he accepts my lavished love that I heap upon him in the form of physical affection and a constant soft burn that makes me want to touch him, always.\n\nI'm thankful for my sister, who is book smart and curious. For my own smarts that aren't from books but are valuable all the same. For an NYE party that went off without a hitch, for the ease of using my small apartment bathtub as an ice bucket. For the inappropriate sense of accomplishment I feel after I clean my flat from top to toe and for someone who comes home and notices it, who thanks me for it. For good communication the fused joy of hard work and love and being able to share that with someone.\n\n\\- L (1/7/2016). tumblr: [hatya](http://hatya.tumblr.com/)",
