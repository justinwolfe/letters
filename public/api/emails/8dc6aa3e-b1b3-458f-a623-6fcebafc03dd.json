  "body": "I'm thankful for all the sunrises I've gotten to see. I'm thankful that I've gotten to see them alone and with the people I love, and that I get to see many many more. Even still, I'm thankful for the nighttime in the city. Nothing is ever too quiet around here, and I don't get left alone with my thoughts often. This is nice so that I don't get lost in myself. I rarely get to see the moon behind all the clouds and light pollution, but when I do I feel grounded. Whether I'm looking at the sunrise or the moon, I know that I'm not the only one looking up. In that sense, I'm thankful that even when I'm lonely, I'm not alone. \n\n\\- the mackerel (6/16/18)\n\n[what are you thankful for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
