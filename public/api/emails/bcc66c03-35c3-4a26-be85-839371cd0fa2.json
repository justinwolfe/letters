  "body": "i'm thankful that the other night after difficult days at work, rather than sit on the couch and watch TV or play videogames, d and i took a walk after dinner. i'm thankful at dusk it wasn't too hot and thankful we stopped at the 24 hour donut shop to get donuts for dessert. i'm thankful for the donut shop employee who was very clearly smoking weed in the back before we arrived. i'm thankful for generous injections of jelly and thankful for maple glaze. i'm thankful for small plastic bottles of milk.\n\ni'm thankful that we called my parents while eating our donuts and then walking home. i'm thankful that my mom was happy to tell us about how she had quit her job at the luxury hotel, where, despite being universally loved by both staff and customers, winning numerous employee awards, and making the hotel more money than anyone else in her position for several years in a row, she hadn't received even a small raise in 4 years. i'm thankful that the day she turned in her letter of resignation, just before she gave her boss the letter, her boss told her that she had been the subject of discussion and praise in an upper level management meeting and had just been given _another_ award. i'm thankful for the glee she took in relating this story to us.\n\ni'm thankful that because she is so well liked, she has friends who work at other better places who are looking out for her and want to have her work with them. i'm thankful that she had d and i work on refining her resume before she starts sending it out again. i'm thankful to remember how for my first job interview, at the movie theater in our town at the end of my senior year of high school, she insisted i not wear a t-shirt. i'm thankful to remember how because my family was antisocial and didn't attend church and lived in florida where you can wear t-shirts all year long, i didn't really have much in the way of formal wear, so i wore my only collared shirt, which was a guayabera i had bought at a vintage store. i'm thankful i got the job. i'm thankful to remember after college how my mom and i took a trip to tampa so i could apply for a job teaching abroad and thankful that i got that job too.\n\ni'm thankful that our neighbors had a garden party last night with our friends and family. i'm thankful for their beautiful garden and for what i think are yellow poppies in bloom now. i'm thankful that they seemed to be having a great time, but also weren't too loud. i'm thankful that we're on good terms with them, but not close enough that we would have had to go to the garden party. i'm thankful that our yard, which had gotten horribly shaggy again, was mowed the other day so that it didn't look so terrible for the garden party. i'm thankful for the strong networks of spiderwebs between the mud room door and the side of the house, which aren't broken even though i open and close the door multiple times a day. i'm thankful for how when the yard was mowed, fragments of grass were flung up into the web and thankful for the way their form helps delineate the form of the web.\n\ni'm thankful that space x's rocket exploded (i'm thankful, of course, that no one was hurt). i'm thankful to last night have finished [_the last days of new paris_](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-New-Paris-ebook/dp/B0180SQC32/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1472816882&sr=8-1#nav-subnav) by china mieville, which is about an alternate universe nazi-occupied paris where the art of the surrealists (poems, paintings, collages) manifests itself into reality in an \"s-blast\" and in which these surrealists and their unpredictable creations do battle against the nazi's, who under mengele and a vichy priest work to summon the forces of hell. i'm thankful for this description of new paris's notre dame: \n\n\"_Since the S-Blast the squat square towers to either side of its sunburst central window have been industrial silos, tall and fat, crudely hammered metal.

'We refuse to flee poetry for reality,' he said, 'But we refuse to flee reality for poetry.' The men and women blinked at him. 'No one should say our actions are superfluous,' Thibaut recited.
