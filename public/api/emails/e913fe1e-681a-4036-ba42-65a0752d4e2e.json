(she's a sag, can u believe) i'm thankful, after trying to do yoga in my little living space tonight, to have cried and broke down on my makeshift mat and that i was treating the breakdown as an extension of all the deep breaths i took. more shavasana. how my body still needs more. in and out. more deep breaths.\n\ni'm thankful to notice how my body reacts and cringes to pain, and for how it also accommodates and houses it. i'm thankful to have taken the benadryl. i'm thankful to have scrubbed my face raw (but in a skincare-y gentle way) of tears, the act of which made me silently sob more in front of my blue sink. i'm thankful to have noticed for the first time, while brushing my teeth absentmindedly and weakly, the patterned blue flowers (i can't tell which kind) of the sink tiles.\n\ni'm thankful for this pain. thankful to know that this is something i will learn from, someday soon but certainly not now. for now i will cry all the tears, take all the long walks in all the different routes in this small city, listen to all the music, do all the yoga and perfect the peaceful warrior poses and have my abdomen and core muscles shake from a nice, good, long plank. also i will be sure to read all the books, including the one she lent me just this summer (\"from my grandmother's house,\" she told me) about a bengali family trying to thrive in america. i, too, am trying to thrive. just not in america.\n\ni'm thankful to make a promise that this time i will not stop myself from feeling all the feelings. i will feel all the feelings, even the ones that i do not want to feel. because i'm stubborn as fuck. i will let myself feel all of them, and from there i'll report back to you. maybe it'll take a long time and you'll no longer care. but still i'm thankful.\n\n\\- kflo (5/29).\n\n[previously](https://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/kflo-8)\n\n[what are you thankful for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/edit)",
