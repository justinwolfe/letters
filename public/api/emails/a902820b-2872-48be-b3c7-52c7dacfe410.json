Also, your relationships should be emotionally supportive and non-punishing_\") which gets me, sure, but also made me laugh because shouldn't everyone's relationships ideally be \"_non-punishing\"_? like could i have answered the questions differently in such a way that it came out with \"Y_ou thrive when relationships are emotionally abusive and punishing_\"? i'm thankful that for whatever the various problems i have inside of my mind to deal with, my relationships are non-punishing.",
