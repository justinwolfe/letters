I'm thankful there's a three-hour meeting in my department's area and I get to work closer to the coffeemaker this afternoon. I'm thankful HR has the cheesiest playlist of Christmas songs on loop.\n\nI'm thankful I had curry for lunch and that the sauce got spicier overnight. I'm thankful I was first in line for the microwave. I'm thankful for the soft hum it makes when it's on. I'm thankful to be mesmerized by my food turning slowly and half-expecting it to blow up in my face. I'm thankful that's never happened. I'm thankful for soft carrots and tender chicken. I'm thankful for the cookie I had afterwards. I'm thankful I laughed at lunch today and contributed little bits and pieces to the conversation. I'm thankful the rooftop was empty when I went up and that I had it all to myself for five minutes.\n\nI'm thankful I had a good weekend. I thankful I had dinner with a friend and we showed up in matching denim dresses. I'm thankful she asked me how I was and I'm thankful I wasn't lying, not even a little, when I said I was okay. I'm thankful she told me about reading dissertations when bored at work. I'm thankful one of them was on alternatives to capitalism. I'm thankful we talked about being corporate sellouts. I'm thankful we can still hope to do good things. I'm thankful we work in the same city. I'm thankful my sandwich came with potato chips. I'm thankful we cried laughing at vlogs on the way home. I'm thankful for 24-hour convenience stores.\n\nI'm thankful I went to an open mic. I'm thankful that although I didn't really feel like showing up I eventually did. I'm thankful that although I didn't really feel like singing I eventually did. I'm thankful I felt rusty and forgot a riff to one of my own songs. I'm thankful no one knew the riff was wrong. I'm thankful for open tunings and strong capos. I'm thankful for calloused fingertips and sweaty palms. I'm thankful someone ran up to the keyboard behind me and starting filling in sections of the song on the spot. I'm thankful that I didn't force myself to stay out later than I wanted to. I'm thankful I went home and re-watched Freaks and Geeks instead. I'm thankful I forgot Rashida Jones was on Freaks and Geeks. I'm thankful I was pleasantly surprised when she popped up.\n\nI'm thankful my co-worker is looking at.gifs for the deck she's putting together. I'm thankful she's looking at a whole bunch of The Office ones and that I can see them from where I sit. I'm thankful I don't work in accounts. I'm thankful I can sneak up to the roof for a break when I need it. I'm thankful I don't smoke as much as I used to. I'm thankful someone put a stop to the cheesy Christmas playlist.\n\n\\- y (12/05/2016).\n\npreviously: [1](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/y), [2](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/y-2)",
