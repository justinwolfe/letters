Reading an Ashbery sentence, an elaborate sentence stretched over many lines, one felt the arc and feel of thinking in the absence of thoughts__...__The best Ashbery poems, I thought, although not in these words, describe what it’s like to read an Ashbery poem; his poems refer to how their reference evanesces. And when you read about your reading in the time of your reading, mediacy is experienced immediately. It is as though the actual Ashbery poem were concealed from you, written on the other side of a mirrored surface, and you saw only the reflection of your reading. But by reflecting your reading, Ashbery’s poems allow you to attend to your attention, to experience your experience, thereby enabling a strange kind of presence. But it is a presence that keeps the virtual possibilities of poetry intact because the true poem remains beyond you, inscribed on the far side of the mirror: “You have it but you don’t have it. / You miss it, it misses you. / You miss each other.”_\n\ni'm thankful to have it, but not have it, to miss it and be missed by it; i'm thankful we miss each other. i'm thankful [the wonderful huge archive of recordings of him reading](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Ashbery.php) that you can get at pennsound. i'm thankful for [o'hara's poem to him](https://twitter.com/mnlolle/status/904449488831602693) and for \"[the circus](https://soundcloud.com/songsabout/the-circus-feat-kenneth-koch).\" i'm thankful for a bit i read in _priestdaddy_ last night, where patricia lockwood writes that \"_meaning, after all, is a kind of luck—some things just shine with it, and no one knows why._\" i'm thankful for [these photographs of fireworks](https://twitter.com/gabriellejwhite/status/904066839923306497).",
