  "body": "i'm thankful for the abortion episode of _bojack horseman_, which we watched last night. i'm thankful for abortion and i'm thankful for jokes about abortion and for art about abortion and for writing about abortion and for anything else that makes women feel more comfortable, safe, and supported about having abortions. i'm thankful for planned parenthood and for any doctor that performs abortions. i'm thankful for this woman who was brave and recently [exposed the morally bankrupt hypocrisy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/politics/tim-murphy-abortion.html) of an anti-choice politician. i'm thankful for every woman who has ever had an abortion, for the women who are having abortions right now, today, for the women who will have abortions in the future. i'm thankful that in this country we have a constitutional amendment that protects a woman's right to have an abortion and i'm thankful that we can continue to push back against the morally bankrupt politicians who are attempting to erode that basic human right with unjustly restrictive laws and regulations. \n\ni'm thankful for \"[panera makeup](http://www.feralaudio.com/14-panera-makeup/),\" the most recent episode of the _glowing up_ podcast, which d and i listened to while playing video games the other night. i'm thankful for how free-flowing and unselfconscious the hosts esther and caroline are, how they talk. i'm thankful for their discussion of bulletproof matcha and for our laughter when esther pressed caroline about what mct oil, a nutritional supplement she had been strenuously advocating for, actually is, and caroline admitted she didn't know. i'm thankful for their long update about what they are eating for breakfast lately and for the way caroline pronounces the word \"tangy\" with an extra emphasis on the \"y,\" which is hilarious to hear over and over. i'm thankful for esther's non sequitir about how hot girls at parties are always diagnosing her with endometriosis. i'm thankful for the discussions of oatmeal, the weird prep rituals required for healthy food trends (boiling almond milk and water together), and the discussion of whether ingestible collagen is bullshit (inconclusive). i'm thankful that during the review section of the podcast, which for many podcasts/vlogs would be spon-con, they provide a (hilariously) harsh review of the product they were trying, and i'm thankful for the digression in that review that gave the episode its name, when they joked about how they would love a panera makeup line with products like creamy chicken and wild rice soup highlighter.\n\ni'm thankful for [shrek pasta](https://twitter.com/whateverr_r/status/915733589622448128). i'm thankful for [kim kardashian as a child watching a magic trick](https://twitter.com/AsyaKardashian/status/915739438470352896). i'm thankful for [this list](https://twitter.com/KavehAkbar/status/916035934159724544) of \"WRITERS WITH THE WORDS THEY DEFINITELY OWN NOW.\" i'm thankful to be [a lunar type in a solar world](https://twitter.com/melissagraeber/status/916139766944378881). i'm thankful that _stardew valley_ is out on switch and i started playing it last night. i'm thankful for the awkward convo d had with our mail carrier about how she didn't always need to ring the doorbell when delivering our many packages but could feel free to leave them on the porch, and i'm thankful she phrased that in such a way to hopefully not make the mail carrier feel rejected or that we didn't want to see her. i'm thankful that  i'm thankful that i have been sleeping better the past few days. i'm thankful that today is friday, even though that puts me closer to sunday, when i'm going out of town for business. i'm thankful that is sad because i will really miss d, even though i'm excited to see my friends from work (i almost called them coworkers but i think of most of them as actual friends, which is another thing i'm thankful for). i'm thankful that the trip will go by fast and then i'll be home again and then the next week will be on vacation. i'm thankful for vacations large and small. i'm thankful i had a good day at work yesterday.",
