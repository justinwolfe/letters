  "body": "i'm thankful that i left my resignation letter in my boss's desk chair at the end of the day yesterday, with a note on the envelope asking her to read it and telling her that i would come by and talk to her when i got in this morning. i'm thankful i figured, since she was coming in earlier than me, that it would be nice to give her the courtesy of reading the letter, which sang her praises and talked about how i am both happy and sad to be leaving, before i came in, since if i came in and gave her the letter, there would be this awkward space where i would either be watching her read the letter or poorly paraphrasing things i said more eloquently in the letter. i'm thankful that though she was sad to see me go, she was happy and excited for me to have a new job. i'm thankful that we both got a little teary and hugged multiple times. \n\ni'm thankful for the new job i will be starting in a few weeks, which i'm really excited about, if a little nervous. i'm thankful that i'll be using more of my skills than i do in my current position and that there'll be much more opportunity for me to learn and try new things. i'm thankful that the job points in the direction of a future career that i think i could like much more than the job i'm currently in, which is something i've felt anxious about for a while. i'm thankful that though the job will be more work than the job i currently have, it's work that i want to do. i'm thankful that i'll get to return, in some senses, to being a teacher, which is a role i always loved. i'm thankful that i know the people i'm working with are nice and the company culture is good and very respectful of work/life balance. i'm thankful that i'll be earning more money and getting more vacation time and that i'll be able to work remotely whenever i want (i'm thankful this could create more opportunities for d and i to travel). i'm thankful for the opportunity to start something new.\n\ni'm thankful that i have been writing a breakdown of my roles and responsibilities for most of the day today and that currently it is at 1300 words of bulleted and numbered lists and nowhere near complete. i'm thankful that my coworker, who i trained to do her position when she was hired, knows almost all of the responsibilities associated with my position, so this is a bit overkill and unnecessary, but also thankful that she's an anxious person and i know that having things on paper will reassure her and will also be reassuring to the person to take over my position if that person is also anxious. i'm thankful that the temp, who is great and smart and who she gets along really well with, seems like a perfect fit to take over my position. i'm thankful to remember how when i interviewed to be a temp here after finishing grad school, my boss asked me if i was okay with being bored, because there was a lot of down time in the job, and thankful that i told her that i loved being bored.\n\ni'm thankful that i wrote notes about the kardashians yesterday evening, even though i try to reserve my evenings for leisure. i'm thankful that my current plan when i start my new job is to try to write my notes in the morning before work (because i start the day 2 hours later at the new job), though some days i may have to write them after work or maybe on my lunch break. i'm thankful, while writing my extra notes last night, to have learned these interesting bits about early smart home technology at the petit trianon from wikipedia:\n\n_A house of intimacy and of pleasure, the building was designed to require as little interaction between guests and servants as possible. To that end, the table in the salles à manger was conceived to be mobile, mechanically lowered and raised through the floorboards so that the servants below could set places sight unseen. The tables were never built, but the delineation for the mechanical apparatus can still be seen from the foundation._\n\n_Within the queen's apartment, Marie Antoinette's need for privacy is apparent: the decor of her boudoir displays an inventiveness unique to the age, featuring mirrored panels that, by the simple turning of a crank, can be raised or lowered to obscure the windows. Her bedroom, although simple, is also elegant in accord with her general style, provided with furniture from Georges Jacob and Jean Henri Riesener. The wallpaper was painted by Jean-Baptiste Pillement._\n\ni'm thankful that i fueled my manic typing with the last 2/3 of a bag of triple double oreos. i'm thankful that i intended to send the triple double oreos to my dad for father's day but accidentally had them sent to my address. i'm thankful to have tried triple double oreos and to have discovered that they are only half as good as regular oreos, in the sense that eating one of the triple double oreos doesn't feel that different of an experience from eating a normal oreo and yet each one you're eating is basically two oreos, which means that you get half the units of oreo enjoyment from each bag. i'm thankful that because i felt jittery and tight after all the sugar and logorrhea, i did some qigong and yoga afterward to slow down and center. i'm thankful i have been practicing my juggling (which is still mostly just throwing one ball from hand to hand, though i am occasionally working with two balls) every day and i can see small bits of incremental improvement.",
