MSG and learning years ago that i could buy it in large bags from the korean grocery store and put it on/in basically everything and it makes the thing better without adding calories or much additional sodium and honestly smdh that we don't use this magic substance more widely because of racism and memes! thankful to shower the delicate crystalline flakes over the slices of too-early-in-the-season tomatoes for our BLTs (with salt and pepper too, of course) and instantly turning them into more appetizing version of themselves.",
