  "body": "i'm thankful that my interview went well (or, at least, felt like it went well). i'm thankful that i prepared answers to the right questions and that i was able to say them rather than read them. i'm thankful that the guy who interviewed me seemed really cool and nice and made me really excited about the job. i'm thankful that for maybe the first time in an interview, i asked questions that actually provided me with useful information. i'm thankful, even if don't get the job, because it was a good experience and i feel like i learned a lot and am more confident in myself for future interviews. i'm thankful that a video interview wasn't as awkward as i thought it was going to be. i'm thankful, most thankful, that the interview is over, and i'm thankful for the whiskey that i drank after it, and for the pizza that we decided to order on a whim. i'm thankful that domino's makes the best cheap delivery pizza here, and i'm thankful that we discovered their garlic crust, which is essential to the previous thank you.\n\ni'm thankful for the amazing time we had with our friends at the distillery last night. i'm thankful that even though we were forced to sit outside because of the restaurant’s baby policy, that was actually better because we had privacy and a heat lamp and ambience. i'm thankful for delicious cocktails and free samples and a delicious house-made jam. i'm thankful for the most fun conversations about everything and anything from planning hook ups for people we know to d never having seen _star wars_ to a time in a grad school seminar where a doc student basically read aloud erotica he had written which included the phrases \"slow circles around the clitoris.\" i'm thankful their baby is very cute and easy to get along with. i'm thankful that they are our friends and like hanging out with us.\n\ni'm thankful for [redacted], which helped me to be more confident and not as stressed.\n\ni'm thankful that my freelance blog post went up today. i'm thankful for the work my editors did to make it better and i'm thankful i wasn't precious about being edited the way that i have been in the past. i'm thankful i have learned to find some distance between myself and the things that i do and make. i am thankful that my ego is smaller than it was in the past, but i'm also thankful it's not dead, which it felt like it was for a while.\n\ni'm thankful for _fallout 4_, which is just getting better and makes me feel temporarily like the alternate version of myself who was playing it the last time i was playing it, years ago, rather than the adult person with adult responsibilities i am now.\n\ni'm thankful for white tea, which is subtle and delicious. i'm thankful that it’s finally cold enough that i occasionally want some hot tea, but not so cold that cold tea isn't also refreshing and enjoyable.\n\ni'm thankful that tomorrow is friday and that even though it will suck that i will have a lot to catch up with at work, it will also be good because that will make the day go by quickly. i'm thankful that at the end of the day tomorrow, it will be the weekend.",
