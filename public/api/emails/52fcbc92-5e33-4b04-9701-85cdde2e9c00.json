(i'm thankful to have gone back and read one of my favorite thank you notes from the very beginning of this\\*, which is about his song \"[the morning of our lives](https://open.spotify.com/track/2rneJaaVTvpEnq22TiCzE9?si=XchkALTERLmNOG3MutPedg)\": [https://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-1-8](https://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-1-8)).\n\ni'm thankful i get to work with kh again, which means talking to her every day like i did when she worked at my last job. i'm thankful that i found out i got some stock options, which i have never had before. i'm thankful that my new computer came and that i ordered a new ultra-wide monitor. i'm thankful to have gotten to start over with my work email and to try to do inbox zero going forward, which i did not do at my last job and have not done in this mailbox, which currently has 1,100 unread emails. i'm thankful for the feeling when i got home for my first day of remote work yesterday of starting my workday without fear or dread or anxiety, which is such a welcome change.\n\ni'm thankful that i had a window seat on my flight home, even though i generally try for aisle so that i can have more space and because hydration is important to me which means also easily getting up to pee is important to me, because the flight was my first flight in a long time that wasn't completely full and so the middle seat was empty and also right when i needed to pee the man in the aisle seat also got up to pee so i didn't have to disturb him. i'm thankful to have watched, via inflight wifi, _the fast and the furious: hobbes and shaw_ on my phone and i'm thankful that it is exactly what you would want from that movie. i'm thankful for the experience of looking out the window of a cross country flight on a clear night where you can see stars above and lights below and it feels like being in space.",
