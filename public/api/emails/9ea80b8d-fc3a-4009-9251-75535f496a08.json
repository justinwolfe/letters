  "body": "i'm thankful we're having chili cheese dogs for dinner tonight. i'm thankful for zach's, the place where i learned to love chili cheese dogs, in my hometown in north carolina, a place that existed since my parents were children and that i can't ever remember not going to, that must have been the first restaurant i visited regularly. i'm thankful to have gotten to go there with d when we went home for my grandmother's funeral last fall and thankful for one of my cousins, who temporarily broke from years of veganism to take a bite of one of the dogs. i'm thankful that my chili cheese dogs aren't as good but that they hit the spot spiritually.\n\ni'm thankful that even though friday was tiring, i was able to accomplish some complicated things. i'm thankful that if i feel exhausted at the end of the day, i'm also feeling some level of satisfaction now, a sense of, if not mastery, at least skill and attainment and accomplishment. i'm thankful for that. i'm thankful for secret dms with my coworkers and thankful. i'm thankful to promise myself to not spend this weekend doing work things like i did last weekend.\n\ni'm thankful that d had a long drunken joyful skype session with her friend who lives in alaska. i'm thankful to remember when her friend visited and we were driving through the night from a party to a bar listening loudly to grimes. i'm thankful for _mr. robot_, which is really getting a little ridiculous at this point but which i am still enjoying. i'm thankful for the _keeping it 1600_ podcast, which offers an entertaining take on the election that doesn't bum me out too much. i'm thankful for the story \"tower of babylon\" by [ted chiang](http://www.metafilter.com/98974/This-isnt-your-grandfathers-science-fiction). i'm thankful for the bits of ben ratliff's _every song ever_ that i read before bed.\n\ni'm thankful that it hasn't started raining yet, which meant that when i realized we didn't have milk for cereal, i could bike to the store to get some. i'm thankful for how surprisingly busy and yet at the same time quiet the grocery store was at 7am on a saturday morning. i'm thankful to have figured out ways to carry grocery bags on my road bike. i'm thankful for the mounting bracket for my bike lock, which fits my non-standard frame size and holds fast.",
