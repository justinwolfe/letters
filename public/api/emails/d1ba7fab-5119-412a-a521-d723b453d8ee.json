  "body": "i'm thankful for a really fun band practice last night. i'm thankful for the comedy of our keyboardist not realizing we were all waiting outside on his porch and his screen door was locked and for the godot-esque play we imagined, in which act 1 is us outside the house chatting about why he's not letting us in, act 2 is him inside the house going through his day, and act 3 is us finally interacting. i'm thankful it was warm and light outside but i'm thankful he did finally let us in and we got set up. i'm thankful to have amused my bandmates with the funny sounds that my new effects pedal makes. i'm thankful that we were locked in and grooving for most of the practice. i'm thankful to have finally figured out a good bass line for one of our songs, which i had been struggling with. i'm thankful we did more free-form improvisational jamming, which is something i enjoy and think is good for us as a band. i'm thankful for our discussion of possible band names and i'm thankful that though everyone else rejected the name \"sexy virgins,\" which i think is a perfect name, i called it for a future side project. i'm thankful we considered the name \"modest moose\" but eventually passed on it.\n\ni'm thankful for [the new jens lekman album](https://play.spotify.com/album/1hXSxD7wpxEHXiLkk69EaQ), which i'm listening to right now and really like so far. i'm thankful for his album _[night falls over kortedela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Falls_Over_Kortedala)_, which i got right before i moved to korea and which was like musical comfort food to me during my first months there in the winter. i'm thankful to vividly remember listening to it while exploring the city my first few days. i'm thankful for his combination of very specific and often hilarious lyrics sung in sweet pop melodies over interesting production. i'm thankful that though i don't normally like \"story songs\" i like when he writes and sings them. i'm thankful for a few of my favorite songs by him:  [kanske ar jag kär i dig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9hoNGZvVT8), [shirin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHjbnsC80_k), and [a postcard to nina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqWu04lrBI0). i'm thankful that when she said they were just make-believe, he thought that she said [maple leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN3Mus6dig0).\n\ni'm thankful to already find myself being pre-emptively missing D in advance of my trip to SF next week for onboarding for my new job. i'm thankful that it won't really be that long of a trip but will still be hard since we haven't really been apart in a long time. i'm thankful for text messages, gchat, email, and facetime. i'm thankful we still have a whole weekend together and that today we are going to go look for a new couch and tonight we are going to a late valentine's dinner at our favorite restaurant. i'm thankful that she's going to get up early on her day off on monday to drive me to the airport. i'm thankful that it won't really be that long of a trip and i'm thankful to start this new chapter of my life.\n\ni'm thankful for [this video](https://twitter.com/swerlspice/status/832713300404211713), which is a moving triumph of the human spirit. i'm thankful for [unorthodox ice cream](https://twitter.com/EmilyGould/status/832644545338810368) and [logos that are puzzles](https://twitter.com/katierosepipkin/status/832807329535897600). i'm thankful for [this parody](https://twitter.com/loyalwinces/status/832105326669348864), which is pretty accurate to my experience of reading slush for an american literary magazine. i'm thankful for gordon ramsay's [twitter reviews of people's food pictures](https://twitter.com/GordonRamsay/status/832670970275979266), which has really yielded a lot of joy for me. i'm thankful for [natural glitches](https://twitter.com/piercegleeson/status/832623578273099776) and for [pretentious pronunciation](https://twitter.com/alicebolin/status/832656851149975552). i'm thankful [to try](https://twitter.com/KathleenMRooney/status/832780088294793217), even when it's hard. i'm thankful for how sunny and warm it was yesterday.",
