i'm thankful he signed the attached card \"_be happy_.\" i'm thankful for how happy my brother was that i could give him our parents' hbo go password so he could watch the latest episode of game of thrones. i'm thankful for the joyful slap echo chugging guitar of the song \"[leather jacket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTWenElxJ8)\" by thunderbitch and the al green EQ of the alabama shakes song \"[guess who](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPnonYHS_IY).\"",
