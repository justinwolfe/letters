  "body": "i'm thankful for the long walk (5 hours) that d and i took around town yesterday, the first long walk we'd taken in a while. i'm thankful for the way that a certain kind of breeze can blend with a temperature and the color of the sky and an emotional state to create the gestalt of perfect weather. i'm thankful for chopped brisket, which is fattier (and thus more unctuous) than sliced. i'm thankful that the barbecue restaurant had their cornbread and pickles, which i think d likes almost more than the meat. i'm thankful for the pleasure of taking a hot bath after a long walk. \n\ni'm thankful, since our bedroom door's hinge has gotten loose again, causing it to drag and scrape across the carpet, to have unscrewed the hinge, shoved more of the compressible metal screw filler that i bought, and rescrewed the hinge. i'm thankful that it seems to be holding better now and thankful that if it gets loose again, i will unscrew the screws and add more filler and screw them again. i'm thankful that i got a new drill bit to replace the one i broke doing another home improvement task and thankful for d, who spotted the right size bit in the inscrutable matrix of screws at the hardware store.\n\ni'm thankful to have removed and washed our sofa cushion covers. i'm thankful that i have considered it in the past but because our couch is a kind of faux-suede, i wasn't sure about how it would work and was afraid they would be somehow ruined, but i'm thankful that i took a chance and they came out fine and nice and clean. i'm thankful while they were in the wash, to have vacuumed all of the crumbs out of the couch. i'm thankful for the ulta coupon i found under the middle cushion, which has been expired for more than a year. i'm thankful to have had a brief flashback to the laundry room in our old apartment building and felt newly thankful that we have our own washer and dryer. i'm thankful for loads of whites and thankful for fresh clean pillowcases.\n\ni'm thankful that d forgave me when i made a rude joke that she hadn't downloaded _mr. robot_ so that she could force me to watch _stranger things_. i'm thankful that we watched the first two episodes of _stranger things_, which were delightful and thankful to look forward to watching more tonight. i'm thankful to consider the source of my apprehension, which i think had to do generally with a disinterest in art about the mental and emotional lives of children (which i don't think is virtuous, but just a feeling i have) and more specifically with the fact that i never watched the movie _the goonies_ as a child, when you are supposed to watch that movie, and then went to a screening when i was in college with nostalgic friends and had a very bitter emperor's new clothes kind of feeling about it. i'm thankful that this apprehension was unwarranted and the show is quite enjoyable. \n\ni'm thankful for the huge birds (eagles? eagle-ish? idk) perched on a lawn that, as i ran by, took off with big flaps into the air. i'm thankful for little bits of vestigial sidewalk that occur sparsely in the country. i'm thankful to have taken a long and leisurely run today and to hope that it doesn't mess with my brain chemistry too much. i'm thankful that the run feels like it helped my back, which i pulled something in last night while bending over and reaching into the drier to pull out the sofa cushion covers. i'm thankful for advil and thankful for yoga.",
