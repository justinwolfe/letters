Imagine getting intimate with your lover, whipping it out of them, and taking a nice long rip. Who wouldn't want a dildo bong_?\"\n\ni'm thankful for the idiot confidence of that ridiculous question. i'm thankful, if you would like some additional dumb reading, to recommend that you check out [this marijuana.com thread](http://www.marijuana.com/community/threads/penis-bong.216967/). i'm thankful to have never gotten [an air pressure boner](https://twitter.com/clocarus/status/806256907275145216). i'm thankful for [unhackable asses](https://twitter.com/hudsonhongo/status/796528589122523136). i'm thankful for trader joes' pinachio cookies and for sweetened dried mango. i'm thankful for the comically oversized bottle of red wine we bought. i'm thankful for sandwiches, especially those which balance the elements of sweet and salty and vinegary with aplomb. i'm thankful for a plum.",
