  "body": "i'm thankful for this season of _bojack horseman_, which might be my favorite so far. i'm thankful that there is a cartoon show where there is a joke involving a parody of a david hockney painting which gets a chunk of its center ripped out by a baby hedgehog and princess caroline says \"we'll tape it back together and call it a rauschenberg.\"\n\ni'm thankful that last night we watched _the nightingale_, which is streaming on netflix. i'm thankful to give a trigger warning for extreme (sexual) violence and that it is a brutal movie that made me think about _the art of cruelty_, but i'm also thankful for the sophistication of its imagery and the kinetic framings and mise-en-scene.\n\ni'm thankful that for dinner last night, d and i had tuna salad and rice and dried seaweed, which is one of the first dinners we loved together (cheap yet satisfying) and hadn't made in a long time. i'm thankful that we got a container one of my favorite panchan, kkaennip, to go with it. i'm thankful for surprisingly tart clementines.\n\ni'm thankful for fun-size candy bars and boxes of nerds, which are like pop songs that always leave you wanting a little more, even though that is bad from a public health perspective, because the satisfaction (and tantalizing hook of future satisfaction) is very satisfying. i'm thankful, though, that we will eventually finish this discounted halloween candy and there will be no more to binge.\n\ni'm thankful that my training was good. i'm thankful that though lots of people came with their coworkers, there were a few people there solo like me. i'm thankful that the training made me realize that my understanding of some fundamentals is pretty good, which is helpful for my confidence, and i'm also thankful to have had some core APIs click for me in ways that they hadn't before. i'm thankful that we got out at 4 and i walked an hour and a half north to get home, the first long solo walk i've had in a while. i'm thankful to have walked home through the sunset, for the experience of watching the sun progress as i do as well.",
