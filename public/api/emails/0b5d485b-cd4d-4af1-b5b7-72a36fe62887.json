  "body": "ice cream in the summer, like what a magic trick that is. i remember still vividly my grandfather making ice cream with fresh peaches in a metal can in the summer when i was a kid and our extended family was all there, a proustian gift/curse which really ruined almost all peach ice cream for the rest of my life (my one exception is jeni's sweet cream biscuits and peach jam which isn't the same but gets me most of the way there).\n\nit's one degree cooler today than it was yesterday and after today it's going to go back to normal temperatures. deborah was lying on the floor to maximize cooling and we were remembering the first apartment we lived in together my first year in indiana, which was two blocks from the back entrance of the hospital and which had a single weak air conditioner and (most importantly) whose windows faced the western sun which in the summer in the afternoon and evening in indiana was so incredibly fucking roasting hot.\n\nthat was also the first summer we got stoned together. i remember the very first time, sitting on the floor beside the bed after being apart for a while and opening this door into a new state of being together. deborah doesn't smoke anymore but this week i have been enjoying the weed strain blue dream, which i was introduced to by my friend n on a warm night in las vegas but hadn't had since. also i thought of a title for my drug memoir it's _the good lord bud.\n\n_i had an all-time great mushroom trip saturday thanks to a variety of factors but i have to hand it to \"lemon tek\" which is grinding your mushrooms into a powder (i did more of a mince but tomato tomato) and then dripping lemon juice on them and letting it marinate and something something science you get more high. it says to do half of what you normally would but instead i did what i normally do plus a bit more for good measure and also i had run 12 miles that morning and so it was just a golden afternoon basking in the glow of serotonin.\n\ni wish it hadn't taken a year but i'm so happy to finally be on another team at work. i know it may just be a temporary honeymoon period thing and i don't want to jinx myself but i just generally feel much less agitation and stress at work on a daily basis (and when i feel them they're usually about like \"CSS is being annoying\" or \"why can't i get this test setup to work\" rather than messier and more intractable interpersonal and group dynamic problems). \n\nmy new manager (who i immediately connected with, i'm so grateful when other people are fast talkers too) was talking about the assets that make this new team great and what she landed on it being a blessed combination of \"rapport\" and \"ownership\" which i know sounds so #hahabusiness and like i am a stooge but i do think it's also kind of true and i'm happy to feel like i can contribute to both those things and my contributions are appreciated and respected. \n\nlistening to the new noname album _[sundial](https://open.spotify.com/album/1RThtoZbeE7OQHMBzaBCJt?si=1z0MIZvGRvWaU21qtwyRsw&nd=1),_ which is incredible, like she is just so fucking good at rapping it's unbelievable_._ found my thank
