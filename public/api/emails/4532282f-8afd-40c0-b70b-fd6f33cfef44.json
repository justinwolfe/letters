  "body": "i'm thankful that it's already above 60 degrees outside and it's only 9am. i'm thankful that this morning when i woke up, birds were chirping outside our window (which is a nice harbinger of spring, even though it's also kind of annoying). i'm thankful that the AHCA didn't get a vote and thankful for every time paul ryan fails. i'm thankful for _exit west_, which is quite good so far. i'm thankful that i had the flexibility to start work early yesterday so i could leave early for early band practice. i'm thankful that at that point it was 70 degrees and i biked over in a t-shirt. i'm thankful we had early band practice because our drummer has a weight lifting competition today. i'm thankful for what a badass she is and i'm thankful for the fun duet jam she and i had together while everybody else was setting up their gear. i'm thankful that the keyboardist's dog was much more chill than she usually is and i'm thankful she likes to have her dog bed in the middle of the room where we practice, so in a sense it's like we're all playing for her. i'm thankful that i thought i would get tired of playing the same songs over and over again, but that it feels like yoga practice—it's about the experience and about finding a center in a moment. i'm thankful that we were all a little raggedy after not playing together for two weeks but i'm thankful that was okay. i'm thankful for the many times when we collapsed with laughter at something silly that happened. i'm thankful that those moments are as important to me as the moments when we lock in and hit our stride. i'm thankful for [armpits that look like faces](https://twitter.com/ClickHole/status/845455271111655424) and [oranges that look like penises](https://twitter.com/ononoimoutonoko/status/845077260289769472). i'm thankful while d was facetiming with her friend to have half-watched _compete to eat_, a really bizarre canadian reality cooking show on netflix which feels deeply yet unintentionally lynch-ian. i'm thankful for these bloopers from _the americans_. i'm thankful for the [new kendrick](https://open.spotify.com/track/41eiwHEX8iegmqmS2cf7oX) and i'm thankful for \"[chanel,](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Nle9hKrkL1wQpwNfEkxjh)\" which is still perfect and just gets more perfect. i'm thankful to look forward to a lazy saturday and to hope that you have a good day today.",
