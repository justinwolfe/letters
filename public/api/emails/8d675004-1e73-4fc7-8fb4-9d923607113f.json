thankful, even though i like the way the album version bangs rough from the start, for the new mix, which adds some pretty arpeggiated synths and cuts away layers to make more space around the vocals

article](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/05/will_apple_music_complete_itunes_destruction_of_my_will_to_collect_music.html), which in part is about how streaming services are

pablo_](http://www.complex.com/music/2016/04/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-changes), even though i also think the idea of an ever-changing album is cool. i'm thankful for youtube, which provides an

the demo of \"[i'll try anything once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RDq5PKcN5g)\" by julian casablancas, which is an all time fave and a perfect specimen of the concept of the bedroom recording.

money to buy it. i'm thankful for rapidshare and megaupload, thankful for crazy captchas and endless popups. i'm thankful that back then, as an archaelogist of anonymous blogspots, i thought i would never buy music again (unless i was at a show and wanted to support the band) and the idea that i would pay for an album on itunes because it seems on measure like less work than downloading a torrent

mealworms, selling them as snacks. i'm thankful to remember reading the book _how to eat fried worms_ when i was a kid and eating a raw worm from my grandfather's garden in front of my extended family to show how brave i was (i'm thankful my brother also ate one, but insisted on dousing it in ketchup). i'm thankful for how surprisingly gritty the worm was. i'm thankful that someday i will eat escargot for the first time. i'm thankful for the sichuan frog legs which i had in a restaurant in chinatown on my first night in new york. i'm thankful for canned octopus and smoked oysters, which with hot sauce and cheese and crackers were two of my favorite snack foods when i was in college and which my roommates always hated because they smelled really bad.\n\ni'm thankful that i was
