  "body": "i'm thankful that yesterday was a much better day at work than tuesday. i'm thankful that i tried switching my schedule so that i did yoga in the morning and then ran on my lunch break rather than the usual vice versa, which i think was a useful variation to my schedule. i'm thankful when i make customers happy with my help and thankful when they say \"thank you so much\" and add one or more exclamation points as punctuation. \n\ni'm thankful to remember that when i am interacting with people in customer service as a customer myself, that all they want is to help you resolve your issue as quickly and easily as possible. i'm thankful to have posted my first knowledge base entry and to have gotten a nice compliment from the developer who requested it. i'm thankful to have started working on my next one and thankful for my excitement that i might get to work on it today. i'm thankful that today is thursday and there are only two more days until the weekend. i'm thankful to be hopeful that today will be more like yesterday than like tuesday.\n\ni'm thankful for the album _let's stay together_ by al green. i'm thankful \"[what is this feeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Czy7c1Kb0I)\" and \"[judy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMWm_IOKB8U)\" which are my favorite songs on it. i'm thankful for crisp, snappy drums and mellow horn harmonies and soft backing vocals. i'm thankful that when the green beans i was going to make as a side dish for dinner turned out to be moldy, we had some kale in the fridge to use as a substitute vegetable. i'm thankful i started our potato baking early enough that it was ready for dinner. i'm thankful for the experience of pressing butter into the steaming starch crevasses of a baked potato and then sprinkling it with sea salt. i'm thankful for sweet ripe watermelon, even if that sweet ripeness makes the chunks from near the center a bit grainy.\n\ni'm thankful that d suggested that the reason my wireless peripherals wouldn't pair with my computer is that i hadn't unpaired them with my work computer, which was the case. i'm thankful to have sat on the couch after dinner playing _starbound_. i'm thankful for _starbound_, which i really like so far. i'm thankful that so far it seems much more challenging than _terraria_, both in terms of locating resources and in avoiding being killed by alien flora and fauna, but thankful that this makes it feel much more worthwhile to accomplish things.\n\ni'm thankful for the twitter bot [poem.exe](https://twitter.com/poem_exe), which slips gems into my timeline daily. i'm thankful that the author has posted the [source](https://github.com/araile/bots/tree/develop/poem_exe) and am thankful to have learned about the concept of [queneau assembly](https://www.crummy.com/2011/08/18/0). i'm thankful for _[exercises in style,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercises_in_Style)_ which i read in college and which was inspiring to me. i'm thankful that malia obama smoke(s)/(d) weed and thankful for [this photo](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--SR5v7EDj--/prh10mqsjyefdxkjnw8h.png) of her, which i return to over and over again and which is so beautiful and powerful and strong. i'm thankful for the key and peele sketch about [obama - the college years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlxkcewBEe0). i'm thankful to never sleep on barry o.",
