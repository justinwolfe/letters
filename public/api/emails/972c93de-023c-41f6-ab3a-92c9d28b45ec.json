  "body": "i'm thankful to be sitting at the gate of the airport where i will get on a plane to another airport where i will get on a plane to another airport where d will pick me up so that we can go home together. i'm thankful that though it will be a very very long day after what has been a very long week, at the end of it i will go home with d and it will be the weekend and we will be at home together. i'm thankful for how happy the prospect of that makes me.\n\ni'm thankful that one of my coworkers is on the same first flight that i was and so we ubered to the airport together and had breakfast. i'm thankful that he is so smart and nice, like all of my other coworkers that i've met, and am thankful to feel like i've gotten a job at a really good company. i'm thankful for the encouragement and praise and guidance that he and all my other coworkers have provided. i'm thankful he watched my stuff while i went to the bathroom and that i am now watching his stuff while he is in the bathroom. i'm thankful that he repeatedly emphasized that this is a travel day at the end of a long work week and that i'm under no obligation to do any work. i'm thankful to have done my weekly update on the company's internal blog, \n\ni'm thankful that unlike on my flights here, where i was nervous and antsy and trying to cram in as much knowledge as i could (until i ran out of stuff i had saved on my phone and watched _bridget jones's baby_, which was truly horrendous though at the same time still somewhat comforting), i can relax and read a book or play a game on my vita or listen to a podcast or watch a movie and actually be able to really pay attention to it without the constant thrumming undercurrent of NEW JOB NEW JOB NEW JOB. i'm thankful that though i checked in late and unfortunately didn't get aisle seats for either of my flights, i at least don't have middle seats. \n\ni'm thankful that on thursday morning, i was able to take a very early morning ride to visit JK, who lives in stanford and who i haven't seen in person since she moved there several years ago. i'm thankful for her daughter, who d and i agree is the cutest child in the world, no competition, and am thankful that she is even cuter in person. i'm thankful to do very broad physical comedy for children and am thankful for how happy it makes them to be chased and blocked and caught and carried. i'm thankful to have gotten to talk to JK about work and life and reading and art (i'm thankful for her recommendation of john berger's _[portraits](https://www.amazon.com/Portraits-John-Berger-ebook/dp/B00R049OJC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)_, which she is loving and which i think i will love too). i'm thankful that soon, she and her family are moving to pittsburgh, which is much less far away than stanford, which means we'll hopefully get to see her more often. i'm thankful that though our visit was too short (as they always are), it was still wonderful.\n\ni'm thankful that my stomach, which i was worried about in such a nervous week, hasn't been too bad and i'm thankful, even though i have loved all the delicious bay area takeout that i've gotten, to go home and cook and eat meals at home. i'm thankful for the prospect after days of rushed showers in a shared bathroom to take a long hot bath with some kind of bath melt or bomb. i'm thankful that tonight i will sleep in my own bed. i'm thankful to be going home.",
