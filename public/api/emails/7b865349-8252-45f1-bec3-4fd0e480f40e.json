  "body": "i'm thankful that i don't feel as anxious about work as i did at the beginning of last week. i'm thankful that last friday was the first day where i felt some semblance of being in control and doing a good job. i'm thankful for the enthusiasm with which some users thanked me for solving their problems. i'm thankful that i only have a double primary shift 2 days this week rather than 5 days, which should make this week less intense. i'm thankful that i don't have to go into the office today, since there are heavy winds and severe thunderstorms rumbling outside. i'm thankful for the good battery life of my computer and for the smooth travel of the keyboard. \n\ni'm thankful for my usual sunday bike ride down to the lake. i'm thankful for the route i found which is pretty quiet compared to other routes i've found. i'm thankful for the way that the elevation changes make it a harder ride on the way to the lake than it is on the way back, which is good since i'm tired on the way back. i'm thankful for the little stretch, about ten miles into the ride, when the forest forms a thick canopy over the road, providing me with cool shade on the long climb up a gentle hill. i'm thankful for the moment at the end of the first leg when i come around a corner and suddenly i'm on a bridge over the dam, with thousands of gallons of water rushing under me. \n\ni'm thankful that i let myself give up (at least for now) on _the mirror thief,_ which got boring, and am thankful to now be reading _[a burglar's guide to the city](https://www.amazon.com/Burglars-Guide-City-Geoff-Manaugh-ebook/dp/B00V35U0TM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1468841989&sr=8-1#navbar)_, which is quite interesting and entertaining. i'm thankful for one of my favorite summer (re)reads in recent years, which is michael crichton's _[the great train robbery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UH4DD6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#navbar)._ i'm thankful for capers and heists. i'm thankful that a couple of weekends ago, i rewatched _inside man_ on netflix. i'm thankful for our little black and decker drill and thankful to have put up some hooks around the kitchen to help it to be neater and more organized.\n\ni'm thankful to have kardashians to look forward to tonight. i'm thankful for [kim's snapchat](http://jezebel.com/kim-kardashian-releases-footage-of-taylor-swift-approvi-1783831287). i'm thankful, even though i like taylor, to see her persona challenged and to get to see how she reacts. i'm thankful for rick rubin, like a sleeping zelig in the background of history. i'm thankful for haagen dazs salted caramel ice cream bars and other delicious things. i'm thankful that my parents sent me pictures of brisket they made in their slow cooker (i'm thankful that in trying to type the word \"brisket,\" i typed \"briscuit,\" which could be the beef flavored snack cracker to finally challenge the hegemony of chicken in a biskit.)",
