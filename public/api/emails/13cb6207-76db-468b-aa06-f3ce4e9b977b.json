One can also extract a three-part, optimistic story from Freudianism, just as one can from Marxism. Rather than being born into a world where property has destroyed our nature, we're born into a world where some original sin was (or was not) committed, a father was (or was not) killed, a mother was (or was not) slept with—but we're born into a world where we feel guilty about that, and we don't have the nature that we would have had, perhaps purely theoretical. We can return to something like that 'natural' condition if we understand the family structure and undergo therapy. But as with Marx, so with Freud: it's a bit unclear just what that utopia would actually be like if one were to get there._\n\n_\\[Judt:\\] In the Freudian story, as in the Marxian narrative, the crucial consideration is unstinting faith in the inevitable success of the outcome if the process itself is correct: in other words, if you have correctly understood and overcome the earlier damage or conflict, you will necessarily reach the promised land. And this guarantee of success is itself sufficient to justify the effort needed to get there. In Marx's own words, he was not in the business of writing recipes for the cookbooks of the future; he merely promised that future cookbooks there will be, if only we correctly deploy today's ingredients_.\"\n\nand this one:\n\n\"_\\[Judt:\\] And yet, she \\[Arendt\\] gets one thing absolutely right. Think, for example, about that controversial phrase: 'the banality of evil.' Arendt is writing in terms that reflect a Weberian grasp of the modern world: a universe of states governed by administrative bureaucracies themselves subdivided into very small units where decisions and choices are exercised by, so to speak, individual non-initiative. Inaction, in such an institutional environment, becomes action: the absence of active choice substitutes for choice itself, and so forth.\n\nRecall that Arendt published Eichmann in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 1960s. What she was arguing had yet to become conventional opinion but would do so within a couple of decades. By the 1980s, it was a commonly held view among specialists in the field that the history of Nazism, and indeed of totalitarianism in all of its forms, could not be fully grasped if it was reduced to a tale of malevolent persons consciously and deliberately engaging in criminal acts with harm in mind.\n\nFrom an ethical or a legal perspective of course, the latter makes more sense: not only are we uncomfortable with notions of collective responsibility or guilt, but we require some evidence of intention and action in order to arrange to our satisfaction issues of guilt and innocence. But legal and even ethical criteria do not exhaust the terms available to us for historical explanation. And they certainly provide insufficient purchase for an account of how and why otherwise nondescript persons, undertaking decidedly nondescript actions (like the management of train schedules) with untroubled consciences, can yet produce very great evil_.\"\n\ni'm thankful, when i am at a loss for words, to be able to type the words of others.",
