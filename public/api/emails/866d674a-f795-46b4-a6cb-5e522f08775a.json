Anxiety and sloth made a formidable team of antagonists because their shared goal was avoidance: avoidance of the gaping maw of job-posting sites; avoidance of other people with their helpful advice and compliments and solidarity, all of which Jen's brain translated into prayers for the dying; avoidance of the immediate outdoor environment, which was bitterly cold and covered in scattering stacks fo uncollected trash and unidentified melting black shit that signified the liminal space between winter and spring in Not Ditmas Park_.\"\n\ni'm thankful for [d's new comic](http://dire.tumblr.com/post/148604656361/i-thought-it-was-dead-or-crystallizing-but-when-i) about her paranoid gardening (i'm thankful for her latest crop of cherry tomatoes, which i blistered with green beans for dinner). i'm thankful, after a few weeks without deer, that there were two fawns in the yard yesterday at dusk.
