  "body": "i'm thankful that the other day d was having a conversation with our friend a about the idea of being known and remembered by future generations after you're dead and whether that is or isn't something to aspire to. i'm thankful that d and i both agreed that we don't really care since we'll be dead but that i then thought about what if there is an afterlife where we can watch the living world continue and had the thought that if this was the case and if i had the ability to do so, i would probably google myself regularly from heaven even though there wouldn't be any results, which is a sad but true statement that made us laugh. \n\ni'm thankful that the other night, d got up from the couch to go wash up before bed and a few minutes later came back with her shirt off and this huge smear of brown goop in her cleavage. i'm thankful that at first i thought this was some weird beauty treatment but i'm thankful to have found out that it was because while sitting on the couch, she was absentmindedly eating a chocolate bar while looking at the internet and a large square of the chocolate landed in her cleavage without her noticing and then was melted by her body heat. i'm thankful that miraculously the chocolate did not get on the shirt she was wearing. i'm thankful to have run my finger through it and licked off the sweetness.\n\ni'm thankful to have listened from the other room while d cleaned out her office drawers to several episodes of the podcast she was listening to, [for colored nerds](https://www.acast.com/forcolorednerds/), which is quite enjoyable. i'm thankful for [the episode with bim adewunmi](https://www.acast.com/forcolorednerds/secrettumblrwithbimadewunmi), especially the part where she talks about how she stopped doing link roundup posts because she didn't want to ruin the pleasure of tumblr by making it her job. i'm thankful to really sympathize with this perspective, which is why i stopped watching _keeping up with the kardashians_, even though i love it. i'm thankful that d had a hankering for it last night and so we [watched an episode from last season](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/858836306230693888) which was delightful.\n\ni'm thankful to have listened to one hour of [this three hour interview with allison williams](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/858850479715082242), which was a really weird experience. i'm thankful for [tabloid art history](https://twitter.com/TabloidArtHist). i'm thankful for [this epic comic about the minimum wage](https://thenib.com/if-they-could-pay-us-less-they-would). i'm thankful for [this HORRIFYING video](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-4442936/Is-disgusting-eruption-pus-yet.html) of a 4 year old zit getting popped (BEWARE). i'm thankful for little yeti chingching's owner [making her a cake](https://www.instagram.com/littleyetichingching/?hl=en) out of pumpkin and strawberries and meat for her birthday, which is a process we have watched for several days on snap. i'm thankful for videos of grandmas smoking weed for the first time ([1](https://twitter.com/TheTimeIGotHigh/status/858146039227965441), [2](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/858829831139729409)). \n\ni'm thankful that we are having [spring rolls](http://mcpaintanddesign.tumblr.com/post/23292000403/asian-spring-rolls-with-peanut-dipping-sauce-i) for dinner this week and am thankful to have done a lot of the prep for them yesterday afternoon, since it is a _cook's illustrated_ recipe and \"_as with all their recipes it is meticulously detailed, the ingredients easily attainable, and it takes a butt load of washing up after_,\" emphasis on the last clause. i'm thankful that we watched the first two episodes of season 2 of _the leftovers_, which were incredible. i'm thankful to have finished the david grann book (which was good if not as revelatory as i had imagined) and to now be reading _in other words_ by jhumpa lahiri, which is pleasurable. i'm thankful to have refilled my pill organizer and for the smell of a freshly opened container of fish oil capsules, which is weirdly like that of a ferrero raffaello. i'm thankful to imagine an alternate universe where all medicines are like raffaellos.",
