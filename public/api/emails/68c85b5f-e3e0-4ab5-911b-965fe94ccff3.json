((and obviously the book is a load of complicated semiotics and shit but i am just going by the yahoo news interview here)). i disagree with eco, although i like his one-liner about how it’s less distracting to write about ugly people (“I was not disturbed by sexual desires.”). i do think that the sign of a truly progressive, radical cinema would involve all of the stars being really ugly, like not just quirky or strange or freaky but flat out mundane uggos like you see on line at the supermarket. i certainly wouldn’t want to watch that sort of thing (it makes my skin crawl just to think about it), but i would respect the statement.\n\n> (and really i’m just kidding, i love ugly people! at zoos, i wave and feed them pellets through the bars of their cages.)\n\n![IMG_0314.jpg](/letters/images/93.jpg)\n\nhe wrote a deeply hurt comment about how disappointed he was in me and then stopped reading and commenting forever and i was ultimately chastened by this and learned to be a better person. or at least that's how i've always remembered it, but the reality is that when i went back and looked at the actual posts, all he commented on that post was \"_you lost me on the ugly_\" and then a couple months later in my big post about the season finale, after having not commented any more in the intervening period, wrote \"_Just so you know, that hills parody with franco and mila kunis_\" (which you can watch [here](https://funnyordie.com/2007/11/29/17666592/the-hills-with-james-franco-and-mila-kunis/), credited to mike white, and which i had criticized on the blog as flat) \"_was something I came up with and was partly inspired by your blog just so you know.
