  "body": "i'm thankful for the gaudy gold-colored foil around the screw-top of the cheap spumante we bought to celebrate the year. i'm thankful for the leftover caramelized onions we had on our hot dogs at dinner last night. i'm thankful that, because we were having guests, i really caramelized the onions for like an hour and a half, coming back to the stove over and over to see tiny hints of the transformation, rather than the lazy rushed sautee i usually do. i'm thankful for the chocolate chip [cookies](http://www.somethingswanky.com/cooks-illustrated-thick-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/) d made, which, even if a little too hardened by the oven and then the air, are still transcendent. i'm thankful that i ate slightly too many of them but not way too many, which is what i usually do when she makes them. i'm thankful that d got slightly drunk (but not way too drunk) on spumante and then whiskey, because she is even more adorable than usual when she is slightly drunk.\n\ni'm thankful for d's sister, e, who schooled me on the value of selena gomez's album a few months ago in the car in southern california when i said that \"good for you\" was catchy and fun but i wasn't really interested in the album i'm thankful that she responded, incredulously, \"but what about 'me and the rhythm'?!?! that album is great!\" i'm thankful for \"me and the rhythm,\" which is excellent, and the album, which is, in fact, great (and so necessary given how lugubrious (if occasionally beautiful) honeymoon was) and which we danced to in the kitchen while making dinner last night. i'm thankful for how lucky i feel that d's sister e is now my sister, and thankful for how much more fun our trip to southern california was because of her. i'm thankful for how she played us the erykah badu cover of \"hotline bling\" which she liked better than the original and i knew what it was and she thought i was cool for knowing that (i'm thankful that even if i know it, i like the mantra of the original better than the erykah badu cover, though i am also thankful for the beauty of the andre 3k duet that was \"hello\"). i'm thankful to remember our long family car trip to LA and how we passed the time by playing would you rather. i'm thankful to remember the question \"would you rather get paid $5000 for cutting off your own finger or pay someone $5000 to keep the finger?\" and how e and d were surprised that i would cut off my own finger for $5000, so much so that while i was in the mcdonald's bathroom, they continued discussing it and then confronted me with the possibility once i came out that what if i had to cut it off slowly with a dull blade rather than a single quick chop with a butcher's knife, which convinced me to change my mind.\n\ni'm thankful for the trip we took to the library where we strip-mined the graphic novel section. i'm thankful for public libraries and thankful for the free shopping sprees that i've gotten to take part at in them since i was a child. i'm thankful for the graphic novels i've read since: [_logicomix_](http://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1451655903&sr=8-1&keywords=logicomix), an okay biography of bertrand russell;
