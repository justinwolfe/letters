In general, I don’t think life or love or poetry is made up of singular, pivotal turning points. They are processes stretched over time and comprising feelings and decisions and materials too complex to be packaged in anecdotes. But in this case, this moment leapt out to me because it actually did happen this way; a single anecdote actually did become a kind of epic hinge in my life. When I reflect on this moment, I feel inspired by love, by its ability to inspire the good kind of risk-taking, and the happy surrender to a mind outside your own simply because you respect and admire it. To remember it to myself and be able to preserve it against the haze that all memories fade into was another objective of the writing. Finally, in the past I’d had a love–hate relationship with Frank O’Hara’s poetry. I didn’t particularly like it for a particularly stupid reason: I didn't want to like anything so many other people seemed to love. This was ordinary ego and envy joining to curb my enthusiasm for the very poet who might have had the most to teach me, in the same way many people like to hold a suspicion of things other people enjoy. So that she recited this famous poem and helped me see its complex beauty in a way that in turn helped me confront the narrowness with which I was reading its famous poet, also felt redemptive. I like the notion that poetry itself, or perhaps a kind of universal soul that poetry in all its forms represents, has a will that resists our narrow human understanding—except in fleeting moments when it reveals its patterns to challenge the pathetic barriers we (who as poets ought to be the most open to its forces) put up against it out of arrogance.
