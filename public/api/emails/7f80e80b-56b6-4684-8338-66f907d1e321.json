  "body": "i'm thankful, at a loss for anything else, to try to describe our bedroom. i'm thankful when at a loss it is sometimes best to commit to doing something small and simple and try to do that small simple thing. i'm thankful that d and i are in bed, me at my laptop and her on her 3ds. i'm thankful that i have a top sheet and a light green fleece blanket and she has two of her own fleece blankets, both blue, one with prints of snowflakes on it. i'm thankful we discovered early on how nice it is to have separate blankets in the same bed. i'm thankful that i have three pillows, each in white pillowcases, one of which is oddly shaped and which supposedly provides orthopedic support; i'm thankful that d has two normal pillows, one of which is in a colorful striped pillowcase that reminds me of fruit stripe gum. i'm thankful that the head of our bed is against the wall and that the foot of our bed is facing east. i'm thankful for the two large windows on the wall to the south, which let in lots of light when we have the blinds open though we don't always have the blinds open because we're often not dressed and there's a giant hole in the fence in the backyard that the neighbors can see through. i'm thankful for the lamp on d's side of the bed, but am thankful it's not on now, since it's early, and instead the fairy lights (i'm thankful for the UK term for this, which is much better than the american term) d hung above the bed are providing soft warm light. i'm thankful for the clothing racks from target opposite the foot of the bed, which store my hanging clothes and for the white bookcase d built which stores her folded clothes (her hanging clothes are in the closet). i'm thankful for the little bedside table on my side of the bed, the top of which currently holds a large mason jar full of water, two empty bowls with spoons in them and crumpled napkins (from our breakfast a half an hour ago—i'm thankful we always eat breakfast in bed). i'm thankful for the small wooden box that contains a scented eye pillow, three chapsticks (one that tastes like peach and one \"medicated\" one that tastes like tea tree oil and which i don't use because it repulses d when she tries to kiss me, but haven't thrown away, and then another one which is out of chapstick but which i also haven't thrown away), a mostly empty container of watermelon ice breakers, a roll of 3m pore tape (for taping my mouth shut, as i think i previously discussed here, it becomes impossible to remember), a couple balled up wads of the used tape, and an iphone headphone dongle that i think still works. i'm thankful on the other side of the bed is a plastic bin thing we got from target, one of those things with three clear plastic drawers in a white plastic frame. i'm thankful on top of that there are my supplement organizer, my pill organizer, several loose bottles of medication (both of my antidepressants in two different strengths, a bottle of pepto bismol tablets, an empty bottle of zyrtec, a bottle of benadryl, a botttle of famotidine (imo the most effective heartburn disruptor)), a half empty pack of orbit peppermint gum, an eighth inch to quarter inch audio cable adapter, the little metal things you put on switch controllers to seal them which i never use, an iphone headphone dongle (which i think is broken but would have to test to be sure), some and some loose earbud tips. i'm thankful that the top drawer is full of my underwear (i'm thankful, since i did laundry a few days ago, that the top drawer is so full it can't currently be closed, the middle drawer with running shorts and various cold weather running gear (balaclavas, etc.), the bottom drawer with socks. i'm thankful that on the floor near the bed there is an old issue of _entertainment weekly_, two old issues of _new york_, my kindle (in a place that is carefully chosen so i can not step on it, as i did recently), a piece of plastic wrapping, the striped boxer briefs i was wearing before bed, the charging cable for my electric razor (which i need to charge now), three t-shirts (one blue, one white, one red), two pairs of sweatpants (both dark gray), a pair of briefs i wore the other day, and some assorted loose socks. i'm thankful for the bluetooth speaker on the bookcase, which is playing _depression cherry_ by beach house. i'm thankful that near the door of the bedroom there is a mirror wrapped in plastic wrap from our move and never unwrapped.",
