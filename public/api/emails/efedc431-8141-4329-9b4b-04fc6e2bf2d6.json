I understand that in the absence of news, our minds will find horrible things to imagine (and that from the horrible massacre on October 7th, there is plenty of fuel for those imaginings), but all the (admittedly limited) evidence that we have thus far from the hostages that have been returned are of them being treated with some measure of kindness and dignity (I know they’re still hostages and, again, of course, they shouldn’t be!). In that light, to me, dropping statements like “ARE THEY STILL BEING RAPED?” reinforces the dehumanizing “human animals” rhetoric provided by the (I agree, fucked!)

That knowledge makes it difficult for me to hold space in the discourse for the kind of sentiments expressed in this person’s post and given that I, like all of us, am powerless to do almost anything constructive, I responded to the post to express my own frustration.*\n\ni'm thankful, since she is a person i otherwise like and respect, that she responded humbly and thoughtfully and expressing a desire to grow, but even if she hadn't, i was thankful for the opportunity she gave me to crystallize my values in the form of some DMs. free palestine, from the river to the sea.",
