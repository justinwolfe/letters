  "body": "I am thankful for the last rays of the setting sun. I am thankful for the soft quality of the sunlight at this time of day, for the long shadows the sunlight casts. I’m thankful to have discovered where to catch this late afternoon light in my new apartment—in the living room, with the curtains that cover the wide door to the patio cast open. I’m thankful for memories of this same light in my first apartment, my college apartment, where the kitchen glowed golden in the late afternoons. I’m thankful for the steady comfort of knowing that this same light will appear every afternoon, barring cloudy days, which are few and far between in Southern California (I’m thankful to take note of that as something to savor about living here).\n\nI’m thankful for daylight savings, which seems to be one of the only markers of the passing of time and changing of seasons in this part of the country. I’m thankful for the hint of colder days and cozier nights, even if the colder days do not come.\n\nI’m thankful for the sparse music of My Bubba as an accompaniment to this quiet fall evening. I’m thankful for the NPR interview I heard with My & Bubba recently. I’m thankful for the confident simplicity of tossing their own names together as a name for their musical partnership. I am thankful for the disjuncture that the juxtaposition of their Scandinavian names produces for English speakers.\n\nI’m thankful that as I’ve been writing these notes, the sun has set. I’m thankful that it will rise again in the morning, but until then, I am thankful for the dark.\n\n\\- krs (11/16/2016).
