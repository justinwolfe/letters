such as writing. i'm thankful that i can choose to become interested and choose to enjoy things, i'm thankful that i can choose not to choose things that i would have to force my enjoyment in, but simply dwell in thoughtless pleasure.\n\ni'm thankful of how this physical classroom is much better than the others. thankful for the extra space, for the extra comfort, with its slightly wider desks that put my regular classroom's desks to shame with their barely-able-to-fit-my-laptop width.  i'm thankful that the colleague sitting next to me smells of nothing. i'm thankful of how my sinusitis has made me less aware of smells which are by nature foul and still enables me to have the pure enjoyment of delectable perfumes, industrial or natural alike. i'm thankful that modern society has made it possible for people to choose to smell of nothing, even if that means we are all becoming less human and humane, little by little, one smell at the time. i'm thankful j enjoys my natural smells and still not as much as i do. i'm thankful that j grasps the humanity in my enjoyment.\n\ni'm thankful for choice and freedom. i'm thankful that the social contract is not so definitive as society the media and politicians make us feel. i'm thankful we can choose to leave society and get lost like alex supetramp does in into the wild, or in a less extreme fashion like m jc j and i did in iceland the past august. i am thankful for conformity. \n\ni'm thankful for the icelandic road trip. thankful for the memories, thankful for the cold, thankful for dalvik and all the beautiful landscape, thankful for the ocean, for the fishy smells of the air and sulphuric smells of the water, thankful for the icelandic people and their distant yet friendly notion of hospitality, thankful for the nothingness we can feel while standing there. i'm thankful for the intense and oppressive vibe of volcanoes and thankful that they remined me of the azores, in a smaller scale and much aged version of iceland. i'm thankful of the earthiness of volcanic islands and for the sour smells coming from the womb of earth and how they remind me of our own human scents. i am also thankful for wombs in general even after my iud insertion. i'm even more thankful for the ability to feel pain, sheer dark twisted ripping-of-internal-organs pain, thankful for bleeding, and thankful for all of those unpleasant things that in the end mean i am alive - and what a thing this is to day. \nI AM ALIVE.\n\ni'm thankful for being thankful and having language which enables me to think of it with depth, and the ability to write which allows me to express it. i'm thankful for aesthetic intention and the capacity to project beauty and perceive beauty in all activities, but mostly in writing. \n\ni am thankful for being able to choose to share this or not, and thankful for the non-consequentialism of all this gratefulness voyage i have  embraced. i'm thankful for justin wolfe and all the marvellous things he has introduced me to, namely the thank you notes emails but also the writingblocks app that i am currently writing on, which allows me to write in privacy in spite of being in class.\n\nf\n\n\\- fsa (2/24/16). portuguese, [mfmcss@gmail.com](mailto:mfmcss@gmail.com)",
