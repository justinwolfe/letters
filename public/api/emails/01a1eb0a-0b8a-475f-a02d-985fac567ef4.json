  "body": "i'm thankful that though i woke up at 5am, for some reason vibrating with anxiety, i slept well until 5am and when i couldn't go back to sleep did breathing meditation which didn't get me to fall asleep again but did feel more restful than laying their vibrating. i'm thankful to try to describe one of the aspects of my anxiety when it's bad, which is that it feels like my ears are microphones with the gain knobs turned up all the way, the EQ tuned to some narrow high frequency band, a delay effect with a lot of feedback, the noise ping-ponging between my ears at faster and faster rates. i'm thankful that this has faded now and isn't as bad as it was earlier.\n\ni'm thankful that i have made time to do yoga the past two days in a row after not doing it in a while. i'm thankful that even if yoga doesn't always help my mental health as much as i hope, it still always feels good physically. i'm thankful in particular for pigeon pose (which helps with my hips, which tend to be very tight) and plow pose (i'm thankful for all inversions, but this one feels particularly restorative). i'm thankful to have written about this, which will hopefully help me remember to make time to do yoga again today.\n\ni'm thankful that d is learning javascript and we get to talk about it together, a new shared context added to the many we already have. i'm thankful for ES6 [for...of loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), which are so much nicer looking than traditional for loops. i'm thankful to be learning how to write more modular code and getting the hang of import statements. i'm thankful that i think i'll be able to make my first pull request for one of our internal tools today, which is a big milestone for me. i'm thankful for the satisfaction of setting up a thing and then the thing working, which still always feels very rewarding.\n\ni'm thankful that we had some particularly shitty customers at work yesterday but they led to some good convos with teammates—i'm thankful that we support each other. i'm thankful that e is watching _the good place_ and we can talk about that now and am also thankful for the new probiotics she recommended. i'm thankful that because we had forgotten to download new shows to watch, d and i watched _the simpsons_ on hulu during dinner (an episode where lisa and marge write their own indie graphic novel, which was surprisingly moving) and then an old episode of _kourtney and kim take new york_ afterward.\n\ni'm thankful that all of my favorite tv shows right now come on on thursday, which means friday night is even more exciting than friday night usually is because i know i'll get to watch _the good place_ and _nathan for you_. i'm thankful that we caught up on this season of mr. robot, which is entertaining and compelling and stylish despite being also kind of totally incoherent and ridiculous (i'm thankful that it feels like if _southland tales_ were a tv show, down to the way both shows occupy haunted seaside settings (venice in southland, coney island in mr. robot)). i'm thankful for k's take on the phrase \"back on my bullshit\" in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/AliaM_H/status/923718003409203201) (and for her bath game, which is very good). i'm thankful to hope that we all stay on our bullshit and never leave it, since our bullshit is who we are.",
