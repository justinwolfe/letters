I’m thankful to take deep breaths. I’m thankful that the airport shuttle is not crowded and so d and i each have our own row. I’m thankful i made sure i have small bills so i can tip the driver.\n\nI’m thankful for the bottle of lemon flavored perrier i bought at cvs, which is very refreshing. I’m thankful that there is a chik-fil-a at the airport. I’m thankful that we don’t have to rush to our flight and i’m thankful that the time difference will be good on the way to las vegas (even if not on the way back)\n\nI’m thankful for d’s old bluetooth keyboard, which i paired with my phone and am typing these notes on now, so that i can type these notes with the speed and fluidity of my laptop but without actually bringing my laptop, which would have tempted me to work on projects which is something i am definitely not fucking going to do on this vacation. I’m thankful, though, that I made a lot of progress on those projects this week and that other people at work were impressed by this. I’m thankful that even though it’s annoying that my phone is making the i at the beginning of every sentence capitalized, that is really not a thing worth being annoyed about.",
