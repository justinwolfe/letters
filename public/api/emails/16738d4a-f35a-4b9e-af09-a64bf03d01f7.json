  "body": "i'm thankful that i realized quickly that i had included an API key for our knowledge base in a publicly accessible website where, i realized quickly, i couldn't delete it. i'm thankful for the intense panic which struck me and thankful that i did the right thing by immediately posting about it to the information security channel in our company's chat app, even though that was embarrassing. i'm thankful, though this happened after working hours, for my coworker, who quickly responded to my frantic apologetic post that he had the ability to disable the key. i'm thankful that though he couldn't immediately disable the key, because it was _the_ key rather than _a_ key (which he said was not my fault), he reassured me that the key only had read permissions and so i had not given anyone the ability to destroy our knowledge base and it would be okay. i'm thankful to have thanked him profusely in a DM and to have secretly ordered him a personalized novelty coffee mug based on an inside joke.\n\ni'm thankful that having a panic attack about the API key during the part of the day where my body was supposed to be coming down from the intensity of work and relaxing was not a good thing, but i'm thankful to have done my best to ride it out. i'm thankful that i had the syntax correct in the get request i was using the API key for and that when i get a new API key, i should be able to do the thing i was trying to do. i'm thankful for sun salutations and i'm thankful for my eucalyptus essential oil inhaler. i'm thankful for old podcasts i have listened to a million times but still like listening to and find comforting. i'm thankful to have a comfortable bed and a working window unit air conditioner. \n\ni'm thankful for the snapchat discover story about muslim pilgrimages to mecca. i'm thankful for the concept of the hajj, which i think is lovely, even if the reality of it seems like it would be so overwhelming. i'm thankful for the kaaba, which is such a mysterious structure. i'm thankful for the strangeness of its black granite exterior and the contrast with the world around it, which makes it possible to understand how people can (and could in the past) make it a focus of their faith and belief. i'm thankful for the way people can invest meaning in rituals and objects. i'm thankful for diaa hadid's [postcards from the hajj](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/world/middleeast/hajj-mecca-saudi-arabia.html?_r=0) series from the new york times.\n\ni'm thankful for the bit i swear is in _to the finland station_ but which i can't find in the bootleg copy i have now, where edmund wilson writes about how marx was awkward and had trouble relating to people in the real world even as he believed in the essential power of community and cooperation. i'm thankful that when i tried to search my email to see if i'd written about this, google suggested the query \"edmund brian wilson.\" i'm thankful for _[red plenty](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0074HCLPE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#nav-subnav)_, the book i am reading now by the author of _golden hill_, which is a polyphonic historical novel about the soviet union. i'm thankful for the section, in which a young soviet woman watches \"[glimpses of the u.s.a,](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=eams+glimpses+of+the+USA)\" a film made by the eames brothers that was projected onto [seven screens embedded in a huge geodesic dome](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/35/2a/21/352a219b8f8e866b91454d15880c5c4f.jpg) in the american national exhibition in moscow in 1959. i'm thankful also for this part, which imagines kruschev discoursing on fast food in new york:\n\n\"_Among the onlookers, on the way to the Waldorf Astoria, \\[Kruschev\\] spotted a small white cart and a man in a white apron working at it._\n\n_'What is that?' he asked Troyanovsky._\n\n_'He is selling lunch to the people, sire.
