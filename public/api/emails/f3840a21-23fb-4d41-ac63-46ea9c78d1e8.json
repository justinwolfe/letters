  "body": "i’m thankful for the coffee cart in the hallway right outside my office which saves me from having to drink the overbrewed folgers that my coworkers take turns making in the break room. the coffee cart coffee is pre-ground blend that sits in an airpot for hours, but it is still better than folgers. i’m thankful for the coffee cart vendor, an older man who lets me use his hot water spigot for free when i have a teabag to steep at my desk. i’m thankful that he gently chastises me whenever i forget to bring my own mug or thermos to fill since the coffee costs half as much that way, even though i’m sure his chiding is rooted in sexism or something. i should object to it on principle but i don’t. i’m thankful that he punches my coffee loyalty card twice sometimes for no reason, so i get to the free tenth cup sooner, which he advises me to save for days when i don’t have a thermos or mug with me.\n\ni’m thankful that we had a cookie party today for a girl who works over in production that i’ve never actually met, who is leaving for a different job. she looks a little younger than me and her name is marsha, which I remembered because i don’t think i’ve ever met a marsha that wasn’t over 45. i’m thankful that my boss told a story at this party about how she used to rescue animals when she was a little girl, wherein she mentioned that if we ever need to feed an injured bird, they really like dog kibble soaked in water. this reminded me of my mom, who told me on the phone last week that she decided to “adopt” the turtledoves who live in the tree outside her bedroom window, one of which she named after her recently deceased dog. i’m thankful that i didn’t say she was just looking for another codependent relationship to fill the void left by the dog, even though that was what i was thinking. \n\ni’m thankful that m got home from his out of town filming gig before dusk. i’m thankful that we immediately agreed to have pizza for dinner since we both had long days, and that i could offer to pick it up so that he wouldn’t have to (i’m thankful that he usually does). i’m always actively looking for chances to be generous to him, since generosity is a behavior that comes naturally to him and i struggle to keep up, though i’m the only one who seems to be aware of this disparity. i’m thankful that next week i’ll have a new therapist to talk to about why i view relationships as transactional, measured in tabulations or dues paid. a thing to be measured at all. i have used this tendency of mine to explain why, during tarot readings in which i ask about an emotional issue involving someone else, i almost always pull cards from the pentacle suite instead of cups.\n\ni’m thankful for the structure of this writing exercise, for its particular rules and its focus on minutiae, which i enjoy writing about. i’m thankful for the person who told me about this email subscription and encouraged me to submit to it. most of all i’m thankful that we still have something in common. \n\n\\- k (2/19/16).",
