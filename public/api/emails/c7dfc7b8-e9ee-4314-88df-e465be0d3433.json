Afterward, it makes the concept of an afterlife or other-life seem conceivable because what was that? And how can I make it happen again_?\" i'm thankful to have experienced this phenomenon many times in my life and to hope that there are many more times in my future.\n\ni'm thankful that my old work let me keep my computer and now it doesn't have any of the bad voodoo associated any more, like magic, and now i can just type emails on it instead of typing on my ipad, which will mean an improvement in quality, since i refuse to use anything other than the most basic-ass default shit like the gmail web-app client and being on an actual computer means that i can go back to doing inline links in these rather than just copying and pasting a big old ugly URL in the middle of paragraphs.\n\ni'm thankful for karafun's subscription model, which is that there isn't one and they sell a week pass or a slightly more expensive month pass but not a recurring subscription and i just keep buying it and it's a great value. i'm thankful for butterfinger peanut butter cups, which are imperfect and yet really much better than you might expect (the butterfinger percentage, despite the branding, feels like about 7%, which is just the right amount of butterfinger).\n\ni'm thankful for \"[another one goes by](https://open.spotify.com/track/3308hstupmMUcRwbam0EPs?si=dX079oAvQzy_77l0ZPM4vA)\".",
