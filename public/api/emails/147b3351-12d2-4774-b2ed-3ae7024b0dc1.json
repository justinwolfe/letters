Yes, it's really too bad. But you know how I loathe those commercials; they can ruin the whole film. Say hello to everyone. We'll see you...Yes, I will. Have fun. So long.'_\n\n_'Was she mad?'

Jonna put the cassette into a slipcover decorated in advance with text and pictures, copies from the film library she'd been collecting all her life, and the cassette was given its dedicated place on the shelves reserved for videos—an attractive, continuous surface of gold and soft colours with little flags on the backs showing the country where each film was made.
