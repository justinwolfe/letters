  "body": "i'm thankful for a small ritual d performs, which is opening the blinds during the day to let the light of the day in and then closing them when we go to bed so that we sleep more deeply during the night the light of the next morning doesn't wake us up before we're ready. i'm thankful, as someone who, left to my own devices, would probably just leave the blinds open all the time forever, for the ways that this gesture changes the space we live in and is an expression of care. i'm thankful now to look out the open window closest to the head of the bed. i'm thankful that from the window you can see, in the foreground, a vine hanging down from a bush on the side of the house, a small detail in close proximity, in sharp relief, that sets off the frame. i'm thankful, in the middle distance, for the lusher grass of the back yard, which isn't patchy and dirt prone like the front but a thick carpet. i'm thankful, in the background of the window image, for the huge honeysuckle that grows against the fence that separates our yard from the backyard of the neighbors. i'm thankful for the honeysuckle, which are now mostly fully grown and yellow, the sign that they are ripest, their scent hanging in the air. i'm thankful that even though i can't smell them through the window (since the window is limited, like all images) i know that it's there.",
