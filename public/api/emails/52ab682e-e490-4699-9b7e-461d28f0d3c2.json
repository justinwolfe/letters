It takes about 100 ms for your brain to plan a saccade to a new location, and about 50 ms for the actual motor movement of your eyeballs rotating in their orbits. Here's the neat part: if you think about it, for each saccade, the light information that is hitting your retina is changing with every. Single. Saccade.
