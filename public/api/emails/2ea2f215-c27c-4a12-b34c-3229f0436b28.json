content. i'm thankful i use the notes app both for personal bookmarking and note-taking as well as to collect material to write about here and i'm thankful for the lack of formal separation between those two realms, even though sometimes because of it things get lost.\n\ni'm thankful for [this tweet by jia tolentino](https://twitter.com/jiatolentino/status/876646694808674304), which was a forceful endorsement that made a book sound interesting to me. i'm thankful for [this essay by wesley morris about the cosby show](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/arts/television/how-to-think-about-bill-cosby-and-the-cosby-show.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share), which was moving and sad. i'm thankful for a conversation i had with d about how i hated pizza crust as a child and refused to eat it but started eating it in college because i didn't have much money and it made pizza last for more meals/be more filling and how now as an adult i could afford not to eat it but i actually like it now. \n\ni'm thankful to have remembered, as we walked past the country club, of the wealthier friends of my parents who would take us as guests to their country club and how they had a tab at the snack bar such that we kids could just go up and get an ice cream or an airhead or a bag of chips whenever we wanted, which to my brother and i was like being in the movie _blank check_. i'm thankful that when we were eating sushi i joked that she had \"wasabi privilege\" because her meal came with much more wasabi than mine.\n\ni'm thankful for a long omnibus note where i noted fragments of things over several days. i'm thankful for a mention of the similarities between the guitar riffs of \"life is a highway\" and \"heart of glass,\" which is something that came up at band practice. i'm thankful that i remembered as a child drinking v8 juice with lots of tabasco in it and i'm thankful to also remember the bloody marys i drank with bottom shelf vodka in college, which tasted like they had batteries in them. i'm thankful i thought of a dream journal tinyletter called \"freudian sleep\" after [a freudian slip](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/876179556767608832) of my own. i'm thankful that i have so many good ideas for tinyletters and podcasts, most of which are based around puns, even though i don't have the time to execute them.\n\ni'm thankful while watching _john wick 2_ to have made a note about how i feel like in movies common is always wearing turtlenecks and to have wondered if that's a costuming imposition or if he just really likes turtlenecks. i'm thankful to have made a note that _john wick 2_ is like if michael scott's movie from the office, _threat level midnight_, was made by an accomplished hollywood crew with a multi-million dollar budget. i'm thankful over the weekend we watched both it and _logan_ and i'm thankful that they were both good and enjoyable movies, even though after both i felt a bit gross with regard to the fetishization of extreme violence. i'm thankful that the big scab on my knee from when the dog we were watching pulled me down to the asphalt fell off while i was walking without me noticing.\n\ni'm thankful that at the grocery store, the woman bagging asked me, while holding a case of la croix, \"_would you like the la croix fast_?\" and i said no awkwardly, thinking maybe she was making a joke about the amount of la croix we were buying or doing that thing baggers sometimes do with gum where they ask if you want them to give it to you or put it in the bag and then realized a beat later that she was saying \"_would you like the la croix bagged_?\" i'm thankful for the proustian artificiality of lemon-scented wetnaps. i'm thankful for [this wonderful essay](http://distorte.tumblr.com/post/161896603245/theres-a-book-we-bought-for-my-niece-and-i-read) about the past, present, and future of grocery shopping. \n\ni'm thankful for the episode of kardashians before the paris robbery, which feels so innocent. i'm thankful for when khloe talks about how she feels comfortable telling kourtney about her new relationship because kourtney gives her space but not kim because kim doesn't (i'm thankful for the description of kim as \"_horny for details_,\" which also describes me and the other viewers of this show. i'm thankful when backstage at the kanye concert in miami, fat joe calls scott disick an honorary member of the terror squad. i'm thankful to be disgusted that scott disick goes to strip clubs so much he has an infantile nickname for them (\"strippie\"). i'm thankful for the moment when he is asking kourtney about a change to the drapes in her house and she's not paying attention and then says \"_i've been busy and haven't really thought about it_\" and he says, shocked, \"_what do you_ do?\" i'm thankful for how many kardashians scenes open with them discussing the intricacies of expensive home decor choices. i'm thankful for a captured moment of kanye being proud of how his muscles look in his outfit. i'm thankful for the shots of kim in the crowd at the concert, lovingly rapping along to \"famous.\"\n\ni'm thankful for the episode of kardashians after the paris robbery, which indulges in the kardashian fascination with ghosts (especially their father's) trying to speak to them from beyond the grave (kim was robbed in paris on the anniversary of robert's funeral and her blackberry alarm, which she had never set (?!), went off unexpectedly). i'm thankful for the bizarre moment where kris is imagining losing kim and compares it to losing nicole brown simpson. i'm thankful for the way that her sisters and family support kim through her trauma. i'm thankful that when kourtney is saying grace at a family dinner they all give her shit about \"_talking in monotone with jesus_.\" i'm thankful for kourtney's constant detached/blase affect.\n\ni'm thankful for [this post](https://imgur.com/gallery/2l6af) about how a where's waldo style video game is made. i'm thankful for [this one](http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2017/06/on-that-one-brilliant-episode-of-murder.html?m=1) about an episode of _murder she wrote_ about virtual reality. i'm thankful for [this
