  "body": "i'm thankful that last night, i accidentally knocked the orange chamois towel that d uses to hold her hair when it is wet onto the bathroom floor. i'm thankful that this is because the towel was hanging on the bathroom door and i went to close the door quickly and the wind produced was enough to shoot the light towel off of the. i was thankful, as i have been when this has happened before (it has happened at least once before) that the towel did not fall into the toilet (which it well could have) but instead just fell on the floor. i'm thankful to have picked it up immediately and hung it from the towel rack by the shower. \n\ni'm thankful that i went to casually mention this to d, that her hair towel had fallen on the floor (but luckily not in the toilet) and that this had happened at least once before and so it might be good to hang the towel in a different, less precarious place. i'm thankful to have been surprised by her reaction of intense disgust and horror at the hair towel having fallen on the bathroom floor. i'm thankful, thinking she misheard me and thought that the towel fell in the toilet, to have reiterated that the towel just fell on the bathroom floor briefly, not into the toilet, and am thankful to have found that she heard me correctly the first time and that it was the idea that her hair towel had briefly touched the bathroom floor that was the source of her revulsion.\n\ni'm thankful for my laughter at this and her laughter and the further laughter we fell into when i said that it seemed that she was more disgusted that the towel had fallen on the floor than if it had fallen in the toilet, which she didn't react to immediately, which i took as a confirmation that she believed it would have been less disgusting for the towel to fall in the toilet, which made me laugh very hard. i'm thankful for the ridiculous hypothetical example i provided of whether she would prefer to eat food that had briefly fallen on the bathroom floor or into the toilet. i'm thankful she eventual stopped laughing long enough to tell me that the reason she would prefer it falling in the toilet is that i would have of course immediately laundered the towel, whereas because of my not understanding the degree to which she felt that the bathroom floor was disgusting, i wouldn't and didn't launder it (i'm thankful that her disgust was compounded by finding out that this same scenario had happened at least once before). \n\ni'm thankful that she and i both laughed harder than we have in a long time. i'm thankful that she moved the towel to a safer position and told me she will never ever put it on the bathroom door again so as to avoid things like this happening and i'm thankful that i work from home and so can do a load of laundry later today and present her with a clean towel. i'm thankful for her various towels and other items of clothing and hygiene paraphernalia around the house. i'm thankful to be surrounded my feminine things. i'm thankful to remember [the weird catholic dream sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8cQ1x0aAk) early in 8 1/2 where guido is in a house full of all the women from every part of his life and it's time for his bath.\n\ni'm thankful for madeleine's notion of a [grieving period](http://tinyletter.com/52wks52bks/letters/week-8-the-turner-house-by-angela-flournoy) after reading a book, which is a thoughtful way to consider that period after reading a book where you can't get into the next book (\"_I always considered these extended moments of silence an important part of the process because it makes the warm glow of another world last longer\")._ i'm thankful to be reading the _parable of the talents_, which because of its resonances with the present day is far more disturbing than the already disturbing _parable of the sower_. i'm thankful for the strange position the earthseed religion holds in the book and how i'm still trying to figure out what exactly it means/is (just like the characters). i'm thankful, when that book gets to intense, to dip into _portraits_, which is wonderful. i'm thankful for john berger's description of images of things or people that are lost except in images and memories:\n\n\"_The sudden anguish of missing what is no longer there is like suddenly coming upon a jar which has fallen and broken into fragments.
