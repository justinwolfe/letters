Saw the walk, heard the voice. Heard him tell the girl in a picture called War of the Wildcats that he would build her a house, 'at the bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow.'_\n\n_As it happened I did not grow up to be the kind of woman who is the heroine in a Western, and although the men I have known have had many virtues and have taken me to live in many places I have come to love, they have never been John Wayne, and they have never taken me to that bend in the river where the cottonwoods grow. Deep in that part of my heart where the artificial rain forever falls, that is still the line I wait to hear._\"\n\ni'm thankful that d and i split the prep work for spring rolls yesterday evening—i thawed and peeled and cooked the shrimp and and cut up the peanuts and jalapenos, she cut the cucumbers and combined the ingredients made the sauce. i'm thankful that i had been annoyed that the grocery store didn't have actual carrots (!) and so we had to buy a bag of precut matchsticks, which felt like a sin but actually was fine. i'm thankful for the ritual of dipping the clear circular wrappers into a dish of water, how they go from being hard plastic sheets to supple skin in an instant, and am thankful for d's careful work wrapping them into neat bundles. i'm thankful for alexa's hilarious/frustrating foibles as we tried to get it to play songs for us while we worked.\n\ni'm thankful that i finally understand javascript promises, which are something i struggled with for a while but which now make so much sense to me and seem so powerful. i'm thankful for the remake of _the magnificent 7_, which i watched while on the treadmill and which, while unremarkable, had a very exciting closing set piece that was nice to run fast to. i'm thankful for the pumpkin pie that d made—i'm thankful that though i never think of it as one of my favorite desserts, it is always really good and something that, while really good, i can control myself with and not eat too much of. i'm thankful for whipped cream.",
