  "body": "i'm thankful that i had a really good time at the party last night. i'm thankful that though it was very hot inside the party because there wasn't any air conditioning, that kind of added to the intimacy of it. i'm thankful our band played a short set and though we didn't have the full drum kit and couldn't turn up our amps very loud, it still sounded pretty good and people seemed to like it. i'm thankful that since our singer is out of town i helped out with the backing vocals, which was fun, even if i'm not a great singer. i'm thankful for the other artists who performed, both of whom were very talented and did interesting things. i'm thankful in particular for this one woman who played solo on a baritone ukulele and whose voice sounded like a mixture of the best parts of cate le bon and joanna newsom. i'm thankful that we might get to jam with her in the future. i'm thankful that i got into lots of really fun conversations with people, including learning about what it's like to be a tattoo artist and what sex and the city characters we were (i'm a miranda with carrie rising), faygo and ICP, and how if it's inappropriate to show trump's head cut off what if we took pictures of paul ryan's dumb face and photoshopped them to give him black eyes and abrasions as if someone had not killed him but just righteously beat the shit out of him. i'm thankful i quizzed people on my current passion project of finding out whether people think [lenin is hotter without his beard than with it](https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/870110274556178434), which seems to be the consensus (no beard). i'm thankful that though the food at the party was gross we ate dinner before we went and so didn't have to eat it. i'm thankful for our friend p, who put a cup of the soup that was on offer in the freezer to chill it, which made me laugh. i'm thankful that though we got home later than we normally would and i am a bit tired now, it was worth it.",
