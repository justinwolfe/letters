And the guy who’s writing the song is in love with her and he kinda wishes she would just be more normal and, like, come on back down to the ground \\[Laughs\\], but she doesn’t. She goes floating over the backyard and past the buildings and the schools and stuff and is absolutely superior to him in every way_.\"",
