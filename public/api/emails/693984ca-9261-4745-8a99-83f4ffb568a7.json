Also for \"Stand by me\". I am thankful that Taemin from the same group was a male lead in a Japanese drama in which I enjoy how awkward he is and how the Japanese way of showing emotions and memories is different than the western one. i'm thankful to have realized i have friends who care about me even when i was focused only on my ex and if he cares/d about me. i'm thankful to have met a very wise and intelligent man, who sensed what i was going through and with whom i had an amazing conversation about energy, psychology, phrenology, sport, music, law of attraction, history, folklore and dance. i'm thankful he will lend me a book about the 5 most common traumas rooted in a person's childhood. i'm thankful to finally feel okay after almost three months. i'm thankful to have gone to a concert where i relaxed without alcohol and danced and had fun alone, with myself and to have met new people even only for the duration of the event. i'm thankful to have found out about Adina River's breathing techniques and sensual body workout since i have been feeling unsexy and uncomfortable in my skin due to the pressure my ex put upon me to look and behave perfectly. i'm thankful i am starting to love myself again and to search for my identity as a person. i'm thankful to know this whole ordeal was a teenage one and i am working on letting it go. i'm thankful for the feeling of being strong and independent and happy alone. i'm thankful for being. \n\n\\- ani (8/16).\n\n[what are you thankful for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X6z1T5sSBXxFpfGI7gPZzQIp_qgkDCsVVCLV4yrw1a4/viewform?edit_requested=true#response=ACYDBNgfNSZ6purPOxf8b4l94qUfSfbXvmo4ftN0dPBeE8-_isWFy_16lY5BIA)",
