We have allowed our love stories to end way too early. We seem to know far too much about how love starts, and recklessly little about how it might continue.​\"​\n\n​and\n\n​\"​Choosing a person to marry is hence just a matter of deciding exactly what kind of suffering we want to endure rather than of assuming we have found a way to skirt the rules of emotional existence.​\"​\n\ni'm thankful after finishing the book i finally looked up what it was called (i didn't want to ruin the magic) and it's Alain de Botton's The Course of Love- i'm thankful whatever whim caused me to download it on july 4th. ​\n\ni'm thankful for september 9, 2016 and knowing that, a little over two years after we first met, j and i will commit to whatever comes our way, to endure together​ and a little recklessly...\n\n\\- esmé (07/29/2016). @esmeawright has been watching waaaay too much game of thrones...\n\npreviously: [1](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm), [2](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-2), [3](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-3), [4](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-4), [5](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-5), [6](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/tyn-esm), [7](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/tyn-esm-7), [8](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-8), [9](http://tinyletter.com/thankyounotes/letters/thank-you-notes-esm-9)",
