  "body": "i'm thankful that i had an awkward experience yesterday when i was meeting a coworker for dinner at the cafe in the fancy grocery store and he wasn't there when i got there but there was this couple who d and i am acquainted with. i'm thankful that the woman in the couple was clearly not making eye contact with me despite seeing me and that rather than do the same, i did an awkward half wave and then turned and exited the cafe, embarrassed. i'm thankful that my coworker got there a few minutes later and i'm thankful we had a nice dinner together out on the patio of the cafe and talked about interesting things. i'm thankful after i relayed the story of how i'd misunderstood a simple thing in python that was different from javascript that he suggested trying to do a basic django project as a way to get more comfortable with it. i'm thankful that on my bike ride home, i came up with an elaborate fantasy about a prank d and i could play on the woman in the couple  i saw where d dmed her on instagram and told her she was afraid i was cheating on d and that i had said i saw the woman from the couple at dinner and that i had told d i was meeting this female coworker but actually she suspected i was meeting a guy i was dating and on and on like this because i love concocting ridiculous things like this. i'm thankful to have made d laugh hard by sharing this story and the fact that i had thought about it so much when i got home.\n\ni'm thankful that d and i spent a long time happily talking to each other yesterday evening; i'm thankful for that, since we were both so exhausted and irritable while dogsitting that we didn't talk to each other much. i'm thankful for our time spitballing ideas for new tinyletters and podcasts. i'm thankful she gave me a demo of a new feature that she oversaw development for at her job, which was very impressive (both the demo and the feature) and that she was impressed when i showed her some scripting i've been working on to make our logging software easier to read. i'm thankful to have had a good first day back at work yesterday. i'm thankful that my weekly meeting with my lead went well and halfway through converted into a long javascript tutorial when i extemporaneously explained and demonstrated the differences between arrays, objects, methods, and functions and the different contexts in which they can be employed. i'm thankful that they seemed to have been helped by my explanations and i'm thankful that i was impressed with myself and my ability to speak fairly authoritatively on these kinds of technical topics.\n\ni'm thankful that d and i facetimed my parents last night. i'm thankful they were entertained by our stories of dogsitting and the dead car battery. i'm thankful that we reminisced about a water park we went to in north carolina when i was growing up and how one of the first times i learned to be truly afraid was in the wave pool at that water park, both because of the general chaos of a wave pool but also because i overheard my dad telling my mom a story about how he had seen a kid get carried into the shallows on a wave and how his back scraped along the rough concrete floor of the wave pool and when he stood up is back was torn up. i'm thankful for my dad's suddenly remembering this moment as well. i'm thankful i have other memories from that water park, such as how my dad and my brother did the bungee drop thing that was outside the park and how i remember watching them and feeling absolutely terrified that they would choose to do such a thing and by how small they were once they had been lifted up to the apex for the drop. i'm thankful that i think i might like to try something like that now as an adult—i'm thankful that though i still have lots of fears, they're not the same as the fears i had when i was a kid.\n\ni'm thankful that there is [a new big thief song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yPKV1Jt6DOYazUvZl4qEI) and that it is very pretty. i'm thankful that i have been getting more and more into mac demarco after listening to his new album a lot. i'm thankful for this early song i'd never heard before, \"[still together](https://open.spotify.com/track/2RLm6OrnjLuoyQEowCJ6QE),\" which is so intimate and the chorus melody of which reminds me of the melody from \"[the lion sleeps tonight](https://open.spotify.com/track/2F4FNcz68howQWD4zaGJSi)\" and i feel like is as close to the melody as you can get without it being copyright infringement. i'm thankful to have listened to a lot of lil yachty yesterday and to have played some of my favorite songs to d. i'm thankful that though i don't think he's a very good rapper i still like the gestalt of his voice and the way it interacts with the beats he chooses (which is the same way i feel about a$ap rocky, though he's definitely a better pure rapper than yachty). i'm thankful that we're going to a housewarming party for one of my bandmates tonight, even though i don't really want to go, both because i'm tired and i'm kind of annoyed at the bandmate for various reasons. i'm thankful to have been a total buzzkill in our band chat thread when the possibility of us doing a basically acoustic set came up and i poo pooed it by saying \"_i think as a band we benefit greatly from amplification,_\" which is something i feel strongly and that our previous partially amplified set was much inferior to our practices generally. i'm thankful that if we aren't feeling the party we don't have to stay long. i'm thankful for french exits, irish goodbyes, dutch leaves, and any other names for getting out of places quickly when i don't want to be there anymore. i'm thankful to be an escape artist.",
