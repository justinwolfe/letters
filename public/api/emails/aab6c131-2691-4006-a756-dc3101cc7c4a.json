  "body": "i'm thankful to have new medication and to feel a bit better. i'm thankful that when i picked it up, i was able to learn the name of a pharmacy assistant whose name i didn't know but had been feeling bad about not knowing because she knows my name and is always friendly to me, thanks to a passing coworker who called out to her from across the store.\n\ni'm thankful that though it was supposed to rain this afternoon, it didn't and so i was able to mow the yard. i'm thankful that though there's a small section of yard in between our house and our neighbor's house that is technically i think our neighbor's yard, i always mow it when i'm mowing because i already have the mower out and it doesn't take me that much longer and i like to see the clean even expanse of grass when i'm done.\n\ni'm thankful, even though i agree that basic human rights shouldn't be up to a referendum, that ireland voted in large numbers to repeal the eighth amendment and legalize abortion, the stories and statements and images around the campaign which are so moving and make me hopeful for the future. i'm thankful for all the american women who are running for office this year.\n\ni'm thankful for how happy flowers make d; i'm thankful for the profusion of peonies she bought at the farmer's market this morning. i'm thankful to smell the incense she lit drifting down the hallway to the bedroom. i'm thankful for the apple slices smeared with peanut butter i had for lunch and for bold flavored chex mix (i'm thankful always for bold flavors). i'm thankful that the first watermelon of summer is in the fridge, chilling for dinner.",
