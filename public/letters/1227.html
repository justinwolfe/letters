      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that on my run yesterday, i saw an &quot;end construction&quot; sign. i&#39;m thankful that those signs always remind me of the calvin and hobbes strip where they read those signs as protests against construction rather than markers of its boundaries. i&#39;m thankful for the calvin and hobbes compilation books we had when i was a kid and for the nice memories i have of reading them both alone and with my mom and brother. i&#39;m thankful for a particular memory, one of those memories that is so strong that you then begin to question whether it actually happened, which is of being inside on a snow day and reading calvin and hobbes and drinking cocoa with those tiny ultra-processed mini marshmallows in it and being so happy.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <em>dragon quest builders</em>, a vita game i got for christmas (and also gave to my brother). i&#39;m thankful for the game, which is very peaceful and pleasant, and for the story of the game, which involves you being a mythical figure called the builder who is sent to a land where people have lost the ability to build things and how you unite them by building things for them. i&#39;m thankful for the parts i have played so far, which involve flitting across the map in search of resources and then returning to build rooms and items for the people in my town. i&#39;m thankful for the things that i am asked to build, which are specific enough to give me a goal but not so specific that i can&#39;t vary them when i want to—i&#39;m thankful that this particular intersection of freedom and challenge has led me to enjoying constructing things more than i did in minecraft when i played that years ago.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i went running outside yesterday, even though it was supposed to rain, because it was somehow 62 degrees. i&#39;m thankful that i couldn&#39;t not go out into that. i&#39;m thankful for the strangeness of a warm day in the middle of winter, which feels impossible and yet happens. i&#39;m thankful to have gone on a reverse circuit of one of my common running loops, which was a nice changeup, especially because it meant that on the most unpleasant hill i was going down instead of up. i&#39;m thankful that about 3/4 of the way through, i started to feel more moisture in the air and i knew it was going to rain. i&#39;m thankful to have picked up my pace in the hopes that i could &quot;beat the rain,&quot; even though this is silly. i&#39;m thankful that the rain is indifferent to my presence, that it will fall when it is going to fall without deferring to me. i&#39;m thankful that it was warm enough and i was hot enough that when the rain did start, it felt mostly refreshing.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for node.js, which i have been learning and experimenting with. i&#39;m thankful that i tried experimenting with it once in the past, when i had my old job with so much free time, but that at that job i didn&#39;t have full admin privileges on my computer which made it hard to tell whether i was doing certain things in the command line incorrectly or was just unable to do them. i&#39;m thankful that i found it confusing and gave up, but i&#39;m thankful since then for the work i have done at my new job and on personal projects since, which has made me much better equipped to learn about and use it now. i&#39;m thankful for the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/learnyounode">learnyounode</a> package, which has provided a helpful primer and useful assignments. i&#39;m thankful that after using them often in event listeners but not really understanding what they are or why they&#39;re necessary, to finally get the importance and power of callbacks. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d and i are going into the office today and are having lunch with our coworker/friend. i&#39;m thankful to hope that a lot of our customers will still be on vacation so it won&#39;t be that busy. i&#39;m thankful that last night in a rut where i couldn&#39;t decide what book to start, i went with <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witches-Suspicion-Betrayal-Hysteria-Salem/dp/031620059X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1482842249&sr=8-1&keywords=the+witches+salem+1692">the witches: salem 1692</a></em>, which is great so far. i&#39;m thankful for a sad and beautiful new <a href="http://tinyletter.com/darcie">tinyletter</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/333333333433333">darcie wilder</a>. i&#39;m thankful for her thoughts on hoarding and editing, among other things:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>my friend asked if i think i&#39;m a hoarder</em></p>
<p><em>but it&#39;s really just that i&#39;m depressed</em></p>
<p><em>or like, how can i</em> </p>
<p><em>how can i throw out my grandmother&#39;s envelopes from 1987</em></p>
<p><em>the packaging is beautiful</em></p>
<p><em>who will save this, if not for me</em></p>
<p><em>im bad at editing, sometimes</em></p>
<p><em>or like</em></p>
<p><em>i can throw it out</em></p>
<p><em>im fine with throwing it out</em></p>
<p><em>i just haven&#39;t yet</em></p>
<p><em>i don&#39;t really care about the envelopes</em>&quot;</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for envelopes both literal and metaphorical, for boxes and all forms of packaging. i&#39;m thankful to have felt <a href="http://firmuhment.tumblr.com/post/465735160">similar things</a>. i&#39;m thankful for a space to put the things i have held onto and share them with you: i&#39;m thankful you give me a reason to hold onto things. i&#39;m thankful to have learned that <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/love-the-fig">figs contain mummified wasps</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr8kHunt6r/status/812092274473631746">hard boiled penguin eggs</a>, even though i don&#39;t want to eat one. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/JustBlais/status/812931637902077953">accidental net art</a>. i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href="http://poemswhileyouwait.tumblr.com/post/154978705018/costco-isnt-the-same-without-you-by-jennifer">costco isn&#39;t the same without you</a>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/jntod/status/813072976069459972">frank o&#39;hara</a> and for <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewEpstein3/status/812719427334574084">joseph cornell</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/andywelch81/status/813169775975272448">this video of george michael rehearsing</a> a tribute to freddie mercury as david bowie looks on from the wings, smoking a cigarette.</p>
