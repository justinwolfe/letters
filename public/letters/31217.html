        <p>i&#39;m thankful to apologize that these notes are a bit late today. i&#39;m thankful to be writing them from the very large and comfortable sofa of the house where we are house-sitting for the next week. i&#39;m thankful for the dog who came with the house and who is such a good boy. i&#39;m thankful for how happy he was when we got to the house and let him out of the garage. i&#39;m thankful that like in a dog in a children&#39;s story if you pick up a random stick and throw it he will go fetch it. i&#39;m thankful to have let the chickens out of their coop into their wire pen and to have fed and watered them and collected four eggs. i&#39;m thankful to hope that the extra zyrtec i took will help with my cat allergies, since i recently discovered that benadryl, which i once considered the poor-man&#39;s benzo, now makes me anxious. i&#39;m thankful to hope i do not spend the whole week itching and sniffling, especially because this is a very nice house. i&#39;m thankful to have the wifi password and that we will be able to get the password for the computer with the VR headset. i&#39;m thankful that that right now the dog is napping at my feet.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the computerized kiosk at the grocery store for ordering things from the deli which helps to avoid that awkward exchange that happens when they bring you a slice of the meat on a piece of wax paper so you can check the thickness and then if you eat it you suddenly have a ham taste in your mouth and a piece of greasy wax paper and if you don&#39;t that feels weird in its own way and then you have to go through it multiple times if you&#39;re buying multiple meats which if i am in the deli i always am. i&#39;m thankful for flavored seltzer and i&#39;m thankful for the giant package of store brand fig newtons i bought in an attempt to make myself eat less dessert by buying dessert that i don&#39;t want to eat that much. i&#39;m thankful for the chocolate ice cream full of chunks of chocolate and ribbons of liquid chocolate we had for dessert last night. i&#39;m thankful for the leftover chinese food we had for dinner. i&#39;m thankful for fried rice. i&#39;m thankful that our chinese restaurant of choice does both the &quot;authentic&quot; chinese food i want and the americanized chinese food d loves (i&#39;m thankful that on their menu, orange chicken is called &quot;orange flavored chicken&quot;).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that <a href="https://twitter.com/selectall/status/840731970879528960">this picture of strawberries</a> doesn&#39;t have any red pixels. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/RuthCurry/status/840907359337762816">this guided meditation about french fries</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/FreshLee_Baked/status/840384298486267906">good samaritans</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/BigRadMachine/status/837164214456307712">the x-files intro with the golden girls theme song</a>. i&#39;m thankful <a href="https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/111127611148742656">to hope my taste isn&#39;t changing</a>. i&#39;m thankful for how much japanese people <a href="https://twitter.com/tinydinosaurs/status/840773646624800768">love putting buttholes on things</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.on-soap.com/guilt-and-shame/2016/12/15/jpymaks867l0av7pgmoal4784bauyl">this podcast on pooing featuring phoebe waller-bridge of fleabag</a>. i&#39;m thankful to have never really liked lorde but to really love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvJaNeELic">the new lorde song,</a> which (maybe because of something about the meter) reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzlMeTxVdH8">yoshimi</a>. i&#39;m thankful that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0WtVtCK5SEFvyyA5V8D9CI">i don&#39;t need no frauds</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6OGzmhzHcjf0uN9j7dYvZH">chanel</a>. i&#39;m thankful that <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html">david letterman is on an SSRI</a>. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/immolations/status/825325708968857600">derrida</a> (though i&#39;m thankful for <em>seinfeld</em> also) and i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/BethElderkin/status/840931014012764160">detournement</a>. i&#39;m thankful there is <a href="https://twitter.com/chillmage/status/840748275267436545">a new way to mute people on twitter</a>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that we finished watching all 46 episodes of <em>terrace house: boys and girls in the city</em>, which is a greatest of all time tv show for me. i&#39;m thankful that we have <em>terrace house: aloha state</em> to watch now, even though it doesn&#39;t seems as immediately promising. i&#39;m thankful for lauren, who is my favorite after one episode. i&#39;m thankful that last night we watched the first two episodes of <em>big little lies</em>. i&#39;m thankful to feel so far like it&#39;s dumb but that i enjoy watching it. i&#39;m thankful to have been reminded of when <em>gone girl</em> was in season and somebody (probably j*nn*f*r w**n*r? tho idk) compared it to jonathan franzen and i read a chapter and was like &quot;nope&quot; (even though i didn&#39;t like his most recent book at all bc it felt like he likes nell zink so much he tried to write a nell zink book and could not do that well because he is jonathan franzen and needs to write jonathan franzen books and couldn&#39;t even finish it) and closed the book, whereas this feels like what i wanted that to be, which is this very particular and satisfying blend of camp and melodrama and social detail. i&#39;m thankful for reese witherspoon and i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/orin_anne">orin</a> who <a href="https://twitter.com/spencerpratt/status/840617512047861760">noticed something about the card</a> for the tequila oprah sent her.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for a really great band practice on friday. i&#39;m thankful that though i was apprehensive because our previous practice was a bit rocky, we gelled really well and had a lot of fun together. i&#39;m thankful that we jammed more than we have in the past and i&#39;m thankful for a disco goof we did that i think actually sounded good and want to return to. i&#39;m thankful we hung a room mic to document the rehearsal and to be listening to the recording of the rehearsal now, which is silly but entertaining. i&#39;m thankful that the drummer and i are facing each other as we play and often crack each other up. i&#39;m thankful that while we were breaking down our gear, we talked about awkward breakups and i was reminded of how the first time i got drunk my freshman year of college and at like 2 in the morning sent my &quot;intro to film&quot; teacher an email about how i was drunk and in love with this girl who was in film school with me and then woke up in the morning and was mortified to realize what i had done and sent the teacher another email saying how embarrassed i was and her very politely responding and saying she hadn&#39;t received it even though it had quite plainly gone to her. i&#39;m thankful for the latest <a href="http://tinyletter.com/brainball">brainball</a>, which has some great crush stories. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/tambourine/status/840620468847677440">weekends</a>.</p>
