      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday morning, i went on the longest bike ride i&#39;ve ever taken (almost 22 miles). i&#39;m thankful, since i&#39;ve had to give up going on long runs because of the weird <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/285400/Strange-symptoms-after-longer-runs">unpleasant mystery symptoms</a> they cause, to have rediscovered cycling as a form of exercise and not just transportation. i&#39;m thankful that like long runs, cycling is great because it gives me a way to explore the world around me and make it new again through that exploration of the places i don&#39;t know. i&#39;m thankful that my range is much greater on my bike than it is when walking or running, which means there&#39;s much more to discover. i&#39;m thankful for the chance to get out of town and into the rural land all around. i&#39;m thankful for the chance to see places and <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/739476594960519170">things</a> that i wouldn&#39;t see otherwise. i&#39;m thankful after ambling aimlessly along the road from the meeting barn for a while, as the world around me got greener and leafier every block, to have thought i was maybe getting close to the lake and thankful that a quarter mile later, at the bottom of a steep hill, <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/739480176157990913">i saw it</a>. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that biking to the lake and back was one of my goals when i started cycling last fall and i&#39;m thankful to have accomplished it and that i am excited to do it again. i&#39;m thankful that the ride back was harder than the ride there, since it made me appreciate more when i started to get close to the familiar landmarks of home. i&#39;m thankful the cheap bike i bought at target held together through all of this, though thankful that i have a decent amount of savings and think sometime soon i&#39;ll buy a lighter road bike, because it is so big and heavy and i bet i could go further on a lighter one. i&#39;m thankful that i didn&#39;t feel ashamed the few times i had to get off and walk my bike up a hill. i&#39;m thankful that at the edge of the nature reserve, pumping hard against the incline, i passed one turtle crossing the road and then, a minute later, another. i&#39;m thankful to have stopped at the nice kroger on my way home to get a drink and pulled up to the bike rack and then realized that i didn&#39;t have my bike lock, so i couldn&#39;t park. i&#39;m thankful for the tiny gas station in the kroger parking lot, where i bought a too-large bottle of red powerade and stood drinking it while cars pulled in and refueled and moved on.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that when i got home, i had a peanut butter cup protein shake (i&#39;m thankful d chose to get this flavor of powder) and half a bag of microwave popcorn and some pork floss and a banana and a container of blackberries and lots of water. i&#39;m thankful for microwave popcorn, which i hadn&#39;t had in years and which was really satisfying. i&#39;m thankful that i lazed around for most of the afternoon in a post-exercise carb coma reading a qigong book and <em>a game of thrones</em>. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of reading <em>a game of thrones</em> after watching all of <em>game of thrones</em>, which is a unique experience since i almost never read the book that a film or tv show is based on after seeing the film or tv show, but always read the book first. i&#39;m thankful that the only books i can remember reading in this way were cheap YA novelizations of movies when i was a kid--i&#39;m thankful for my two favorites, <em>street fighter</em> and <em>the last action hero</em>, which i must have read countless times even though they must have been terrible. i&#39;m thankful that i guess novelizations are less important today, since it&#39;s easy for kids to see whatever content they want whenever they want, whereas the scarcity of the originals in the old days made these smudgy paperback representations feel so valuable.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the experience of reading <em>a game of thrones</em>. i&#39;m thankful that i pushed on beyond my initial reflexive issue with the <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/739586437901877253">linguistic anachronisms</a> of historical fiction, which had kept me from getting very far in it (and many other books) in the past. i&#39;m thankful that weirdly, because i know the characters and plot are so distinct to me from the show, their images embedded in my brain, it feels kind of like i&#39;m reading fan fiction of the show, even though i&#39;m actually reading the source text. i&#39;m thankful that it feels like <em>really really good</em> fan fiction, though, fiction which is serving to broaden and deepen my experience of the characters and the world as i move along the familiar path of the plot. i&#39;m thankful to have gotten to witness arya&#39;s relationship with jon snow early on and to find out (or be reminded of the fact) that he&#39;s the one that gave her needle. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that last night i didn&#39;t sleep well, with the same symptoms i&#39;ve had from long runs. i&#39;m thankful that maybe this is a lesson in not pushing myself too hard, even though i didn&#39;t feel like i was. i&#39;m thankful that even when i don&#39;t sleep well, now, it&#39;s just annoying and unpleasant rather than a stage on which my brain makes plays of all my worst anxieties and convinces me that i may be dying. i&#39;m thankful, very much, for that change in the game of my life. i&#39;m thankful that waking up in the morning is just a thing that happens now, the thing that comes after a stretch of (mostly) sleep, whereas in the past it often felt like the end of a long and difficult journey through the dark night of my soul. i&#39;m thankful that breakfast still feels satisfying even though sleep isn&#39;t as hard as it used to be. i&#39;m thankful that kroger now produces a generic version of cinnamon toast crunch and that i had a bowl of it this morning. i&#39;m thankful for cinnamon and sugar and the combination of the two.</p>
