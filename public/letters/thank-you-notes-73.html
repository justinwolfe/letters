      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i&#39;m thankful for a nice saturday after a long week. i&#39;m thankful that i cleaned the house, even wet swiffering the floor, which i sometimes skip even though i cook enough with open skillets that the kitchen floor gets oily. i&#39;m thankful that we rode our bikes across town for d&#39;s eye exam. i&#39;m thankful that it was unexpectedly cool out, so that we didn&#39;t get sweaty. i&#39;m thankful that while d was at the eye doctor, i rode my bike aimlessly through neighborhoods over by the mall that i hadn&#39;t ridden through before. i&#39;m thankful that riding around them felt like adding data to the invisible map of town that lives inside of my brain; i&#39;m thankful that i gave myself the opportunity to test that and thankful for the satisfaction of eventually coming around a corner or through an intersection and seeing a familiar landmark and suddenly knowing where i was. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, that said, that when d texted me to let me know her appointment was over, i used google maps because i didn&#39;t want to make her wait. i&#39;m thankful that we stopped at the mall and she got some new extra low-cut socks to wear with her keds. i&#39;m thankful that i bought a bag of chips deluxe cookies and d got a bag of reese&#39;s flavored chips deluxe (even if the cookies were disappointingly soft rather than crunchy and crispy). i&#39;m thankful that on the way back through campus to downtown, i led us along a street which was recently resurfaced and so was wonderfully smooth. i&#39;m thankful that d got her prescription at cvs and had a coupon which we used to buy probiotics. i&#39;m thankful for the funny coincidence, after we left cvs and rode the five minutes home, to have looked at my phone and seen that i had a five minute old text from cvs telling me that my prescriptions were ready for pickup.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful we ordered a pizza for dinner, even if it did exacerbate my acid reflux (i&#39;m thankful it was worth it and thankful to suffer for pizza). i&#39;m thankful we watched <em>spectre</em>, which was often very stupid but an entertaining enough experience. i&#39;m thankful for christoph waltz. i&#39;m thankful that a particularly stupid moment in which a henchman played by a professional wrestler is able to pause and utter the line &quot;<em>oh shit</em>&quot; before he is pulled out of a speeding train by a rope tied around his neck to ponder the binary re: superhero movies of the serious nolan-y grimdark vs. the fizzy semi-ironic action comedy. i&#39;m thankful that even though i think it&#39;s the unpopular stance on the approval matrix to prefer the grimdark, i tend to find self-seriousness and antiheroic difficult men less annoying than jokes i don&#39;t like, though i don&#39;t think this is a particularly superior moral stance and like everyone (&quot;everyone&quot;) i think it would be great if there were fewer of these kinds of movies in general.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that it&#39;s supposed to rain all day. i&#39;m thankful for rainy days where you don&#39;t really have to go anywhere. i&#39;m thankful for the idea of nature enforcing or supporting human laziness. i&#39;m thankful to still be in bed. i&#39;m thankful that i started reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Babel-17-Empire-Star-Samuel-Delany/dp/0375706690">babel-17</a></em>  by samuel r. delany, which i started the other day and is great so far. i&#39;m thankful that it feels much more accessible than <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dhalgren-Samuel-R-Delany/dp/0375706682">dhalgren</a>,</em> which i have tried and failed to start a number of times (but which i have a new hope i might be able to read sometime because of my affection for this book). i&#39;m thankful that the main character of the book is a famous poet who can use her super-focused powers of observation and language to read people&#39;s minds (i&#39;m thankful for the way the book literalizes the anxiety of influence in her fear that she is literally stealing her poems from other people&#39;s thoughts) and who is working to decode mysterious transmissions in a cryptic alien language. i&#39;m thankful that to fly spaceships in this universe you need dead (semi-dead? ghost? zombie? not totally sure) people, as well as a trio of navigators who must, in addition to working together, be involved in an emotional and sexual relationship in order to properly, for lack of a better term, <a href="http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2013/05/21/how-does-jaeger-piloting-work-in-pacific-rim">jaeger</a>. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/naomiaweber/status/748827818092625920">this defense of difficult art</a> from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/books/geoffrey-hill-dense-and-allusive-british-poet-is-dead-at-84.html">geoffrey hill</a>. i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/danaanmm/status/749405905662332928">Alison brie Larson von trier</a>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for these photos of <a href="https://twitter.com/adultblackmale/status/749381073671299072">jack nicholson eating a sandwich</a> on a boat in the mediterranean. i&#39;m thankful for wesley morris always but especially in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html?_r=0">this hilarious review</a> of the blake lively surfing movie. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/t-magazine/hanya-yanagihara-swims-marthas-vineyard.html">this hanya yanagihara essay about swimming across martha&#39;s vineyard</a>, which is lovely and surprisingly free of torture. i&#39;m thankful that <em>a prairie home companion</em>, which was always such a crushing folksy disappointment to come across when turning to NPR on a long drive in the days before podcasts, is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/02/media/garrison-keillor-retirement-prairie-home-companion/">ending</a> (i&#39;m thankful to ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8y3jbuuzDg">why anyone would want to leave baltimore</a>). i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://theringer.com/sriracha-is-a-quintessentially-american-flavor-46febefe46#.713w70c4k">this danny chau essay about the americanness of sriracha</a>. i&#39;m thankful for this picture of <a href="https://twitter.com/miragonz/status/749028124906565632">a melancholy dog in gray sweatpants</a>.</p>
