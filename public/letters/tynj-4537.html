        <p>tw: suicide discussion</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my grandparents. i&#39;m thankful that while they would not accept my girlfriend or my gender identity, i have a support system outside of them that means i can respond to this with anger and not hopelessness, as i would have even a year ago. i&#39;m thankful for my girlfriend. i&#39;m thankful for the internet, which connects me with this support system even when i am trapped in a small space with people who do not accept me.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that this year i finally cut people out of my life that were not bringing me joy, to use a phrase from marie kondo. i&#39;m thankful that i read marie kondo&#39;s book this year, even though i have not applied her techniques to my physical space, because her chapter on clearing out one&#39;s mental life has helped me immensely. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that my big &#39;purge&#39; of objects this year was not brought on by a desire to feel joy but by my depression. i&#39;m thankful that everything i got rid of is sitting in my brother&#39;s old room, rather than out of my life, because i might want some of it back.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that this year when i wanted to kill myself, i called the crisis center instead, and while i do not remember that conversation i know that i was crying and that the woman on the phone with me was kind and helpful and only hung up when i was with the police officers, who were similarly kind. i&#39;m thankful that they talked to me the entire time and did not do anything without telling me that they would in a calm voice, which helped with the anxiety.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for that emergency room visit and for all that paperwork, because without it i would not have been able to focus. i&#39;m thankful for a friend of mine, who found my mom&#39;s cell phone number and called her to tell her what was happening even though i asked her not to. i&#39;m thankful that the next day i told her i was sorry for being upset, and she told me i was being silly, and that she knew. i&#39;m thankful that my parents drove an hour to get me in the middle of the night. i&#39;m thankful that my stepdad did not chastise me, but told me that i was brave for calling in the first place. i&#39;m thankful to recognize that the antidepressants i was taking were too strong for me, and to have switched to another. i&#39;m thankful to feel stable, and to feel happy that i did not kill myself, and that i have not wanted to since that day.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that 2016 is almost over. i&#39;m thankful that this wasn&#39;t the worst year to date for me, personally, but that i always look forward to fresh starts. i&#39;m thankful for new year&#39;s resolutions, and specifically when people talk about them. i&#39;m thankful for every person that resolves to go to the gym more or get healthy, because even if they do not follow through the desire is there, and i think that&#39;s wonderful. i&#39;m thankful for hope, both in myself and in others. i&#39;m thankful to know that my resolutions have to be self-care-focused, because otherwise i will worry immensely about &quot;failing&quot;.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for this headache, which is making it hard to focus but which was brought on by fourteen hours of sleep, which i needed. i&#39;m thankful that i&#39;m with my parents right now, which means i can go to bed and wake up when i like and they will not be upset. i am thankful, however, that i&#39;m going back to grad school in a week and will have to adhere to a schedule again, which is better for me in the long run. i am thankful to look for a job, because i spent my first semester without one and i am confident that i can handle working and going to school at the same time. i am thankful that i could focus on school for the last few months, and to recognize that is not a luxury that is available to everyone.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i want to write again. i&#39;m thankful that i do not want to drink again, and that i have not for the past three months and am not planning on starting. i&#39;m thankful that in the last few months i have taken to telling people what they mean to me, and that this has overwhelmingly been met with returned kindness. i am thankful that people agree that i am a kind person now, because for a long time i was known to be very mean and i have worked hard to change that about myself. i am thankful that i could change. i am thankful to be happier now.</p>
