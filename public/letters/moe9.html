        <p>i&#39;m thankful i went to a social networking event tonight. i&#39;m thankful it was christmas themed. i&#39;m thankful this annoyed me because i don&#39;t like themed parties and also, christmas. i&#39;m thankful i refuse to buy a christmas jumper because i don&#39;t enjoy them. i&#39;m thankful that because i wasn&#39;t wearing a christmas jumper, i felt self-conscious. i&#39;m thankful i could only get there about an hour late because of work. i&#39;m thankful this worsened my anxiety. i&#39;m thankful i had to calm myself down by saying &#39;you&#39;re okay, you&#39;re okay&#39; over and over again. i&#39;m thankful this helped avert a panic attack i saw coming. i&#39;m thankful to realise i might have freaked someone out. i&#39;m thankful for the picture of me stood on the side of gloucester road, giving myself a hug and whispering to myself. i&#39;m thankful to not care. i&#39;m thankful it was actually okay and i had fun. i&#39;m thankful some of my colleagues were there and i had great conversations with them. i&#39;m thankful for m, who got a new job she&#39;s starting on monday. i&#39;m thankful for how excited she was and how happy i am for her. i&#39;m thankful for j who got married last month. i&#39;m thankful i asked about his honeymoon and actually enjoyed hearing about it. i&#39;m thankful he asked how my phd is going and i gave him an honest answer- going okay. i&#39;m thankful we talked about it for a while and he told me how happy he is for me. i&#39;m thankful he said it&#39;s been great watching me through the years. i&#39;m thankful to have not noticed the years.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for some of the work i&#39;m doing in the lab at the moment. i&#39;m thankful one of the more interesting ones is with essential oils. i&#39;m thankful to have gone with p, my colleague to holland and barrett this morning. i&#39;m thankful for holland and barrett which tries to sell itself as a healthy store. i&#39;m thankful this makes me angry. i&#39;m thankful a &#39;healthy&#39; store should not have weight loss pills for sale. i&#39;m thankful that even though i know this, i spend a lot of money when i go there. i&#39;m thankful i don&#39;t go there often. i&#39;m thankful we bought star anise, eucalyptus oil, lime oil, clove oil and grapeseed oil. i&#39;m thankful we went overboard. i&#39;m thankful we&#39;re trying to study the antimicrobial effects of essential oils. i&#39;m thankful for the flapjacks i bought at holland and barrett.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for lunch in the refectory today. i&#39;m thankful it was mutton curry. i&#39;m thankful i bought it because i don&#39;t cook meat for myself. i&#39;m thankful it should have been great. i&#39;m thankful it was awful, it was awful. i&#39;m thankful it came with a mango slaw and that saved my lunch. i&#39;m thankful my coconut flapjack also saved my lunch. i&#39;m thankful to still have the icky taste of fat in my mouth. i&#39;m thankful for my dinner of fruit loaf and sardines. i&#39;m thankful i haven&#39;t had sardines in a while and am always surprised by how much i like them.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful l and i had our connect group over on tuesday. i&#39;m thankful because i really enjoy throwing dinner parties. i&#39;m thankful for how much detail we put into planning the evening. i&#39;m thankful to sometimes make the effort. i&#39;m thankful for the sweet potato stew i made. i&#39;m thankful everyone seemed to enjoy themselves and it was an all-round great evening. i&#39;m thankful that after serving the food i ran away to my room for about 20 minutes for introvert time. i&#39;m thankful i realised i needed it. i&#39;m thankful my friends now understand how much i need this to be sociable. i&#39;m thankful i like spending time with people i like and feel safe with. i&#39;m thankful i made too much food (i cooked enough to feed about 30 people!). i&#39;m thankful l took a picture of the mountain of food i was making and sent it to people on their way to us. i&#39;m thankful that because i cooked too much i was able to take the leftover stew to work with me for my colleagues. i&#39;m thankful that when i told them i was bringing food in they were all excited. i&#39;m thankful to think that i helped make someone&#39;s day brighter with food. i&#39;m thankful food is one of the ways i know how to love people. i&#39;m thankful people seem to enjoy food i cook.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful after writing all this to state that i am tired. i&#39;m thankful this year has been hard and tough and i can&#39;t believe i have at least 20 more working days before i get a break. i&#39;m thankful just thinking about it makes me cry. i&#39;m thankful but i&#39;m tired. i&#39;m tired. really tired. it&#39;s been awful and i&#39;m tired to my bones but i&#39;m thankful.</p>
