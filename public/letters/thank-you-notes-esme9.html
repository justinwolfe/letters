        <p>-7/21 thursday-</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i currently feel shit at my job. a few weeks ago i said yes to a full-time position in hopes that it would help me become less delusional. it‚Äôs working. i‚Äôm thankful that i‚Äôve absorbed so much advertising-speak-jargon that in my attempt to write my very first proposal, ever, i‚Äôve completely unravelled. yesterday as i was struggling with it, i actually had a ‚Äúwhat is life‚Äù moment and wanted to cry. Last night as i tried to explain it to J i just kinda blabbered and then had another moment where i very seriously doubted my ability to speak or explain anything clearly.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i feel the same way right now. i‚Äôm thankful that my boss is editing this proposal less than 10 feet to my left and i really can‚Äôt do it. i literally cannot explain in simple words what we‚Äôre going to do for this company. and i don‚Äôt know why. all that seems to come out is bullshit and confusing ad-speak. i‚Äôm thankful that i feel like a failure. i‚Äôm thankful that i‚Äôm doing an okay job of preventing that black wave from tearing me from the surface that i‚Äôm treading on. i‚Äôm thankful that when the thoughts of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna get fired‚Äù swim from the depths that i‚Äôm keeping them down.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i just turned to my boss and kinda blushingly stammered to my boss that i was struggling. i‚Äôm thankful that he‚Äôs really supportive and not at all mad. i‚Äôm thankful that all murkiness and storminess immediately disappeared and it feels literally like day to the night a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>-7/22 friday-</p>
<p>i‚Äôm really thankful that i made a really blatant mistake that was just made clear at this new job and i am sitting here wanting to cry. i‚Äôm thankful that i am so incredibly hard on myself and it‚Äôs because i hold myself to a really high standard and this job has felt like my skillsets are unravelling because i had really been coasting for awhile. i‚Äôm thankful that my coworker im-ed me back saying</p>
<p>dont worry, t___ seems pretty calm</p>
<p>ive seen him be mad before, and he is def not mad</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that the wave of emotions is slowing already and i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm drowning. i‚Äôm thankful that my immediate response is ‚Äúi‚Äôm going to be fired‚Äù which is a feeling that i‚Äôve been getting since i was actually fired from the full time job i moved to nyc with. i‚Äôm thankful that to this day, if i think too much about that job i start to have a massive anxiety attack. i‚Äôm thankful because people who knew me when i was there knew that there was nothing i could do, no amount of work or effort that would have prevented it. this was when i was arriving at work at 7:30/8a and sometimes not leaving until 10pm. i am thankful to know that i can do the work of many people, take a lot of shit and still not seem to please someone. i‚Äôm thankful that to this day i don‚Äôt really know what i did wrong. i‚Äôm thankful that after a lot of turmoil and establishing my freelance career, i took another full time job. i‚Äôm thankful that it was strange from the beginning and that i wasn‚Äôt able to really say what it was. most days felt like i was back in highschool or back in this old job, tiptoeing around, trying not to piss off the wrong person. it began to feel very much like the old place. like everyone was eying me and just waiting for me to make the wrong move. i was fired on a thursday afternoon, the same day my best friend moved out to go to LA. i called her crying from union square and she had already made it to Ohio.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i have this other equally awful reaction which is complete fuck-it self-justifying apathy. literally i think, well this can‚Äôt all be my fault. i‚Äôm not solely responsible for your bullshit. i didn‚Äôt know what was going on. yadda yadda. i‚Äôm thankful that i know that this is just me trying to violently counteract the blame.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that in the last few months i‚Äôve had a realization that i don‚Äôt dwell well in the area between the two extremes. that i really don‚Äôt know how to be placid, or just really okay. for so long i would avoid okay as it was the representation of everything status quo and middle america bland. i‚Äôm thankful that i‚Äôm starting to see it all as swimming in the ocean. and that you can‚Äôt swim where the waves break violently nor can you swim close to shore where the tides most drastically rise and fall. the best places to swim are where the water stays relatively calm, even though it‚Äôs always moving.</p>
<p>so i‚Äôm thankful that this note is helping me find the calm even though my instinct is to seek out the opposite.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i ran into my friend ren√© and she told me because i was lost in myself for the moment ‚Äúthat there‚Äôs something to be said for being full of grace‚Äù and i‚Äôm thankful that i agree.</p>
