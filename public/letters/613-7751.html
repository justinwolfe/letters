        <p>i&#39;m thankful that though the trail near our house where i go running every day is closed for maintenance, which depressed me because we live on a busy road with a small and dangerous shoulder and i need to run every day to not feel like shit, that got me to go down a nearby road i hadn&#39;t been down, just a bit further down the busy road, which turned out to have sidewalk for as long as i needed for my run, which was a nice surprise. i&#39;m thankful that though i prefer a flatter trail, it&#39;s good for me to run on hills, which this route had, sometimes. i&#39;m thankful for the middle school near the road, which is probably the reason it has such good sidewalk coverage, even though it is a very ugly middle school that reminds me of the prison they lived in on that one season of <em>the walking dead</em>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/YokuGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">yoku&#39;s island express</a>, which is the video game i&#39;ve been playing lately and which is like an adventure platform game except where instead of being a little person who runs and jumps around as in most of those games, you&#39;re a little pinball and you traverse the environment by way of bouncing off of pinball paddles. i&#39;m thankful for how pleasurably (and sometimes pleasurably difficult) it is to move through a game world in this way, an island made of linked pinball machines. i&#39;m thankful for how even though some parts are hard, they never feel as hard or impossible as actual platformers like <em>celeste</em>, because even if you&#39;re playing a complex pinball game, it&#39;s still, at the base level, just pinball, and if you keep trying, you&#39;re going to eventually hit the ball right.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://medium.com/@aubreybellamy/letter-of-recommendation-send-tweet-a517795ddbeb">this essay</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/aubreybell">aubrey bell</a>, who is my favorite tweeter. i&#39;m thankful for how interesting it was to read her write longer prose, since all of the writing of hers i&#39;ve consumed has been in this other form, a form which lends itself to a certain kind of voice and tone and structure. i&#39;m thankful for how she conceives of her twitter account as a way, amid struggles with mental health problems and the general horror of the world, to &quot;<em>provide quantifiable proof that [she] wants to be alive</em>,&quot; that, in this light, rather than her twitter account being the paraphernalia of an addiction or a waste of time or something that serves to exacerbate her mental illness*, the body of her tweets (jokes, groans, observations, silly thoughts, puns) is that necessary evidence that she is alive and wants to keep being alive, &quot;<em>over 20,000 pieces of evidence to prove it.</em>&quot;</p>
<p><em>* &quot;I was depressed before I was on Twitter. There are millions of articles, studies, (and tweets) linking social media to mental illness. Aggressive use is either a symptom or it is a definitive cause. We are urged to ‚Äúunplug‚Äù, ‚Äúdigitally detox‚Äù, or ‚Äúlog off.‚Äù As if closing our (god-given) apps and switching to a dumb phone will rid us of an ill formed long before the internet and will sustain past it, should we get there&quot;</em></p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that on the new medicine i have been feeling mostly good during my workday and mostly kind of crappy in the evenings, which isn&#39;t ideal but on balance still better than before and i am hopeful this will continue to improve. i&#39;m thankful to know it was bad that i worked on a work project in the evening last night, which did not help matters at all, but that i am not going to beat myself up too much because i have generally gotten better at not doing that and i was happy for the progress i made. i&#39;m thankful i have been doing yoga in the mornings before work, which is good, and that i think what i hypochondriacally feared was a hernia is just a muscle i pulled during a hip opener. i&#39;m thankful, on our hard floors, to have borrowed d&#39;s thicker yoga mat, which makes the movements more pleasant. i&#39;m thankful that yesterday a friend at work told me that a conversation we had was a &quot;happy bright spot&quot; in a difficult day.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though it has been raining heavily every day since the weekend, today is supposed to be the last day and then it will be sunny again. i&#39;m thankful to have felt bad because when i was trying to mow the yard last friday morning, i started mowing the little patch of grass i share with our neighbor that i told you about before but then the mower ran out of gas and there was no gas to refill it with and i felt bad, like what i had envisioned as a small good deed actually turned out bad by leaving our neighbor with this uneven lawn, and then i felt worse because the continuing rain meant that the grass was never dry enough for me to get out and finish the job. i&#39;m thankful, though, that our neighbor has not seemed to care, and the rain had made the surrounding grass grow up so that the two-tone effect is not so pronounced, and on the weekend i got a new backup gas can and filled it up and i&#39;ll be able to do it again soon. i&#39;m thankful that grass continues to grow, even if that means i have to cut it; i&#39;m thankful for rhythms and for cycles.</p>
