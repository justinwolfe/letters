        <p>i&#39;m thankful that today is administrative professionals&#39; day, which meant that we had stale bagels and coffee in the office at 8:30am and i did not have time to write my notes this morning. i&#39;m thankful for the cheery delivery person who brought in the bagels and coffee and assorted paraphernalia to the office, which i neatly arranged on the credenza opposite my desk (i&#39;m thankful for the well-meaning but tiring conversations i had with three different faculty members about the irony of me setting up the spread for everyone for administrative professionals&#39; day)(i&#39;m thankful for when being thanked by someone doesn&#39;t require much emotional labor on my part, which unfortunately it sometimes does in my interactions with (well-meaning) faculty). i&#39;m thankful to have thanked the delivery person and to have pondered how, for the problems i have with my job, i feel very thankful that i&#39;m not a delivery driver and am thankful for the hard work of people who are. i&#39;m thankful for the plastic tongs that are used to pick up bagel halves and thankful, since there are a lot of colds going around, that the bagels were halved in advance, even though that just emphasized their staleness.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my manager, who is a great person. i&#39;m thankful that she always speaks kindly and appreciatively toward me and that i feel supported by her always. i&#39;m thankful for the funny faces and knowing glances and eye rolls we share in the hallways and while passing each other in the office. i&#39;m thankful that she recently gave me a &quot;task&quot; that involves getting to have a nice walk across town and which she normally reserves as a treat for herself. i&#39;m thankful for our discussion this morning about a recent boat maintenance fiasco, from which i learned that there is an important difference between wet sanding and dry sanding. i&#39;m thankful for her love of her doberman puppy, who is graduating from obedience school today. i&#39;m thankful for the conversation we had about problems she&#39;s been having with her husband&#39;s ex-wife (i&#39;m thankful for how she sweetly termed the abusive and obscenity-laden text she received from the woman a &quot;nastygram&quot;). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that later in the social event, when the accountant, who is very conservative, initiated a conversation about the presidential election that i was afraid of having, but thankful that through the magic of conversational jiu jitsu, i managed to guide us through it without either of us thinking the other was a horrible person. i&#39;m thankful for the faculty member who i overheard talking about how inspired he is by a student of his who has been volunteering for bernie sanders in neighboring states on the weekends and who was going to get to meet him after bernie&#39;s speech on campus today. i&#39;m thankful for the long conversation i had with the academic advisor about the election. i&#39;m thankful that i volunteered that i had given money to bernie early on and felt that he shared more of my policy positions, but had recently been feeling myself shift toward hillary (i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://sadydoyle.tumblr.com/post/138860699828/progressive">this powerful essay by sady doyle</a>, a writer who i think i once condescendingly described as &quot;shouty,&quot; which is a large part of what changed my mind). i&#39;m thankful for the advisor&#39;s talk about the work she does with the anti-poverty group at her catholic church and for our discussion of how, regardless of who the nominee is, how happy we are that anti-capitalist ideas and critiques of structural inequity in all forms and entrenched racism and sexism have become part of the wider public discourse (especially among young people) in a way that they haven&#39;t been for a long time. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that after calling several times over two days without getting to talk to a person and, the final time, sitting on hold for 7.5 minutes, i finally got through to an admin at my doctor&#39;s office to make an appointment to discuss medication side effects and dosage changes. i&#39;m thankful that i chose to reframe my annoyance and think of sitting on hold as an opportunity for meditation and thankful for how as i strolled the corridors, i was able to use the amount of glitching and tearing in the repetitive hold music to map out the dead spots for cell signal in our building. i&#39;m thankful for how the admin i eventually talked to apologized for the delay and said that they were having trouble transitioning to a new computer system, and thankful that i said in a nice tone of voice that i understood (and thankful that i did understand, having been in that position myself before) and that it was no problem. i&#39;m thankful that she thanked me for my patience and thankful that even though she couldn&#39;t get me an appointment for three weeks, because i was nice to her she taught me two tricks, one to possibly get an earlier appointment if there are cancellations and one for if i ever needed an urgent same-day appointment.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the student who was in the office filling out his internship registration paperwork and who i heard making what i thought at first was a loud breathing sound, perhaps because of congestion. i&#39;m thankful that i realized that he was in fact vaping in the office, which is the first time i&#39;d experienced that phenomenon and which i found so entertaining i didn&#39;t even tell him to stop. i&#39;m thankful for the gentle aroma of the cloud of vape juice he left in the office. i&#39;m thankful that the department chair thanked me for hanging pictures on her walls, which i am technically not supposed to do. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/04/27/cabin-in-the-snow/">this little browser game</a> about shoveling snow, which is probably a better thing for me to keep in another tab than twitter. i&#39;m thankful to remember the scene in the <em>mad men</em> episode &quot;<a href="http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/The_Suitcase">the suitcase</a>&quot; where peggy and don are working late on a campaign and peggy says, &quot;<em>you never say thank you</em>&quot; and don yells, &quot;<em><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjM_87kya_MAhVKu4MKHZa8ADgQyCkIITAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D77Y6CIyyBcI&usg=AFQjCNEH_845_0mO6VzxdW3-FkRLuecpRw&sig2=S3rsd3Jnp_bPsWDMOFIOAw&bvm=bv.120551593,d.amc">that&#39;s what the money is for!</a></em>&quot; i&#39;m thankful for arbitrary holidays designed to remind people of invisible labor that&#39;s taken for granted, but i&#39;m more thankful for the money, which i receive by direct deposit every two weeks.</p>
