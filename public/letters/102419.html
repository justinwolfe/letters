        <p>i&#39;m thankful that though yesterday wasn&#39;t as good of a day as the two previous days, there were still good things about it nonetheless.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the big pull request i worked on all tuesday was accepted without any notes and i could merge it</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful i had an impromptu pairing with ec and even though we couldn&#39;t make the thing she wanted to happen happen because of a stingy limitation of a Slack API, we figured that out rather than her worrying that she was doing something wrong, and i&#39;m thankful we had a nice therapeutic chat.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though the kind engineer shut down an idea i provided to solve a problem with one of our microservices for being too short term and duct tapey of a solution and that made me feel shame, because it&#39;s another example of my naïveté in making architectural decisions, and dread, because the more responsible route he wants to take is going to mean a lot more work and work in the backend in python which takes so long because of problems with our local dev environment and my lack of comfort with python and backend programming is not my favorite kind of work, i at least won&#39;t have to do it all alone and i will learn from it, as i have in other journeys into the backend, and i&#39;m thankful that another engineer joined the thread and pinged our managers to try to get buy-in from them for prioritizing doing the work together. i&#39;m thankful to  try to not let abstract fears of the future control my appreciation of the present.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for a coworker who i have always liked but haven&#39;t really interacted with because of timezone reasons sent me this message out of nowhere, after i ended my day &quot;<em>I just wanted to say that there&#39;s something I learnt from you that has legit been one of the best things i&#39;ve ever learnt at work, and that was to really visually show you&#39;re engaged and listening when people are giving presentations with head nods etc. Seems so obvious but it&#39;s played a big part in trying to make people feel comfortable when</em> <em>they&#39;re presenting ideas:heart:</em>&quot; which made me feel proud about the vibe i&#39;m putting out, which sometimes i worry about. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have run the asynchronous meeting that i&#39;m supposed to run every week but didn&#39;t run last week because i was pressed for time and because articulating things seemed hard. i&#39;m thankful i put the prep time for the meeting explicitly on my calendar, which is something i&#39;ve seen other people at work do and which i feel was helpful and should do more of.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have broken out one of our dogshit joints after work, even though i was trying to save it for the weekend, because it hit the spot.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that though i did not make the recipe i was intending to make for dinner last night (<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020103-pasta-with-roasted-broccoli-almonds-and-anchovies">https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020103-pasta-with-roasted-broccoli-almonds-and-anchovies</a>) because i was working late again, d understood and we got poke delivery instead. i&#39;m thankful that d did a mammoth pile of dishes and that she offered to make the recipe today.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the <em>watchmen</em> tv show, which i wasn&#39;t expecting much out of but which i thought was excellent top to bottom, with some big lindelof energy i had been really missing in my available TV options.(i&#39;m thankful to have put down <em>overthrow</em>, which i had thought was going to be like <em>the leftovers</em> but was instead like a really boring version of <em>mr robot</em>). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the comfort of being in bed with no clothes on under the covers, because even if you feel anxious or depressed or otherwise unwell, being in bed is still more comfortable and nice than having those feelings other places i think.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that this morning in between waking up and getting up, i pulled miso up to the top of the bed and snuggled her up against my chest and covered her with my gravity blanket and she seemed to enjoy it. i&#39;m thankful, if cold weather is encouraging her to be more affectionate, for cold weather.</p>
