        <p>i&#39;m thankful that though d&#39;s car is in the shop, we were able to get groceries yesterday because the grocery store is only a few blocks from our house. i&#39;m thankful that when i first moved here, without a car, i lived even closer to the grocery store, which made living independently and cheaply possible. i&#39;m thankful to remember the little apartment i lived in then, which had countertops that weren&#39;t properly connected to the cabinets below them and so would slip and slide if you put too much weight on them. i&#39;m thankful to remember that its window was west facing, which meant that the heat of the evening sun would come in and make the evenings brutal, even if the air conditioner was on. i&#39;m thankful to remember when my landlord replaced my hot water heater and suddenly i could take very long hot showers, which is one of my favorite leisure activities. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday we walked our bikes to the grocery store so that we could load them up with bags to carry on our way home. i&#39;m thankful that though this seemed like a clever idea it was actually more trouble than it was worth and it definitely would&#39;ve been easier to just carry the bags (i&#39;m thankful to know this for next time). i&#39;m thankful that we were able to get all the things we needed, even the heavy things, except for eggs and whipped cream, which we forgot and i need to buy today after my run or bike ride (i&#39;m thankful it is going to get into the 60s this afternoon). i&#39;m thankful that yesterday evening when i was cleaning up the kitchen i found our scale and stood on it for the first time in like a year and found out that i was ten pounds heavier than i expected to be. i&#39;m thankful to have responded to this horror by manically doing crunches on our bedroom floor. i&#39;m thankful to hope that the coming of summer will make possible more endurance exercise that will help with this. i&#39;m thankful that i bought a proper standing desk (instead of what i have now, which is this cheap rickety stand that i put on top of our washing machine).</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to know that it is stupid to be upset that d refused to listen to bjork with me in bed this morning, even though i repeatedly told her that i wanted to listen to bjork with her and instead listened to bjork on her headphones. i&#39;m thankful to know that she was trying to be kind, since she knows i&#39;ve never really liked bjork, even though part of me wanted to try listening to bjork in bed this morning, both to share it with her and in the hope that in sharing it with her, i might find a way to like bjork (in the same way that i did not like that tay tay and zayn song the first times i heard it but came to love it in time). i&#39;m thankful to know that this is a stupid thing to be annoyed about, that it&#39;s not her job to teach me to like bjork when she has her own things to do and since if it were so important for me to try to like bjork, i could quite easily listen to bjork by myself on my own headphones (which i don&#39;t actually want to do). i&#39;m thankful that i have been sitting in silence while writing these notes in some kind of stupid protest and i&#39;m thankful to have realized how stupid that is while writing this paragraph and to put my headphones on right now. i&#39;m thankful to interrogate my irrational feelings as a way of reducing their power over me. i&#39;m thankful that pitchfork does reviews on the weekend now and i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23052-liquid-liquid-ep-successive-reflexes-ep-optimo-ep/">sasha frere-jones on liquid liquid</a>. i&#39;m thankful to be listening to lower dens, a band i totally missed for some reason but whose music was delivered to me via algorithm recently and who hit so many sweet spots of things i like (they feel like a more post-punk beach house). </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday evening we watched the movie <em>i don&#39;t feel at home in this world</em> on netflix. i&#39;m thankful for melanie lynskey, who was as wonderful as she always is (i&#39;m thankful <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/848306814793986049">to have daydreamed with emily</a> about a project starring all my favorite actresses). i&#39;m thankful that i did not find elijah wood annoying in the movie and i&#39;m thankful that though it wasn&#39;t perfect, it was quite fun. i&#39;m thankful to still be enjoying <em>the wanderers</em>, which has a pair of husband and wife characters that both remind me of myself. i&#39;m thankful that i finally got the raspberry pi i bought months ago up and running (i&#39;m thankful to have bought an ethernet cable, which made getting it connected much easier, and to have realized that i needed to reformat the SD card and reinstall the OS on it and set it up to accept SSH connections before booting up). i&#39;m thankful to remember using telnet as a child who had no idea what he was doing and feeling like a hacker and to still have a tiny aura of that when connecting to a remote server from terminal now.</p>
