        <p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/presidents/status/760821462966099968">carina&#39;s memory</a> of getting called out by an older girl on xanga for using hurtful feminist stereotypes and how that changed her for the better. i&#39;m thankful to remember that on my old wordpress blog when i was twenty two, the writer and director mike white commented to express his disappointment about me posting a song i had written and recorded called &quot;<em>all the ugly people in the world should be shot,</em>&quot; which was a loungey thing that began &quot;<em>all the ugly people in the world should be shot / kill them all and leave everyone that&#39;s hot / let&#39;s line them up and shoot them in the streets / their ugly blood will run by our pretty feet</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that, like in carina&#39;s case, i was attempting to be satirical, but thankful to have been called out on the affected shallowness and hurtful stereotypes i was deploying in the song and the post that contained it in order to feel/seem &quot;cool.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that while it was bracing to read this critique of my stupidity, it was important and it changed something inside of me in a significant way.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for a year or so later, when i sent my long distance friend s copies of my white boy hip hop covers of e-40&#39;s &quot;tell me when to go&quot; and jay z&#39;s &quot;girls, girls, girls&quot; and &quot;hola hovito,&quot; she very gently but firmly told me about the importance of recognizing and resisting the misogyny that permeates a lot of hip hop, which was an issue i had never thought of. i&#39;m thankful that i unthinkingly spit the n word in those covers, which is something that makes me cringe now but was something i had never thought about being inappropriate back then. i&#39;m thankful to remember doing karaoke years later with a friend who is nigerian and thankful that before i did my first song, i listened to and noticed her skipping over the n word a song she was singing and, despite being drunk, took this as a clear communication of what i should do when i did my song. i&#39;m thankful that in the first song i did, &quot;99 problems,&quot; when i skipped the first n word, she seemed to visibly relax a little and smiled at me. i&#39;m thankful to have done young money&#39;s &quot;bedrock&quot; in the same manner later in the evening, which is the best karaoke experience i&#39;ve had.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that early in our relationship, d and i went to dinner with another couple and our friend c to the local irish pub. i&#39;m thankful for the other couple, who were our good friends, even though that evening they were annoying me by monopolizing the conversation, such that i was just sitting there bitterly eating mediocre fish and chips. i&#39;m thankful that i got increasingly annoyed and that when i finally got an opportunity to say something, i was telling some story about d and addressed her as &quot;<em>this bitch</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful for the moment of dead painful silence that followed, which was then broken by our friend c giving me a dark glare and saying &quot;<em>d, you have my permission to slap him</em>.&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have apologized (though probably not well enough) to d when we got back to my apartment after the dinner and thankful that she accepted it. i&#39;m thankful to not have ever used the word &quot;bitch&quot; in anger again, but i&#39;m thankful that the issue recurred some time later when she got made when i referred to some chocolate chip cookies i loved as &quot;<em>slutty</em>,&quot; which i thought was an interesting and poetic way to describe the overwhelming buttery sweetness of the cookies but which d described was using a demeaning and offensive word that hurt her and other women. i&#39;m thankful that around this time, we also had another conversation about the b word in hip hop, where i used the totally played arguments about it, because of its syllabic and phonemic composition, its way of functioning as the glue holding flow together, meant that it had evolved from a specifically misogynist slur into a unisex insult, the equivalent of &quot;asshole&quot; or &quot;motherfucker.&quot;</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d is a strong person and she did not let my &quot;logical&quot; argument, which i kept repeating that day with small differences, drown out the personal pain and humiliation she felt when she heard me or others use the word &quot;bitch.&quot; i&#39;m thankful that eventually i stopped being a stupid little shithead and finally heard her and stopped using the word &quot;bitch&quot; altogether. i&#39;m thankful that at first, this seemed to be a huge diminishment of the range of my personal expression that i was having to force myself into in order to appease her, but thankful that stupid selfish feeling quickly faded and i realized it&#39;s actually totally possible to be as profane and cutting and funny as i want to be without using a word that is specifically targeted at demeaning women. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that now when i hear others use the word, in conversation or in art, i experience a small tinge of its wrongness, of the anger and hatred baked into it, which is not the same as what it must feel like to hear it as a woman but feels like a kindred emotion. i&#39;m thankful that not liking to hear the word hasn&#39;t prevented me from listening to hip hop, even though it&#39;s knitted into the lexicon of even generally thoughtful and progressive rappers. i&#39;m thankful, though, that i <em>am</em> aware of it whenever i hear it in a new song i love, since when i hear a new song i love, i usually think about sharing it with d but then think, &quot;<em>why does this great song have to have this hurtful word in it that will, to whatever degree, diminish her enjoyment of it?</em>&quot; i&#39;m thankful that after the conversation where d changed my mind about using the word, the next time i was home visiting my family, my dad and brother were using the word casually for some reason and expected me to do the same and i&#39;m thankful i said &quot;<em>i don&#39;t say that word anymore</em>&quot; and i&#39;m thankful that didn&#39;t make me feel small or weak but instead made me feel strong.</p>
