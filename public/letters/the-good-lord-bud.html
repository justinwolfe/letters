        <p>ice cream in the summer, like what a magic trick that is. i remember still vividly my grandfather making ice cream with fresh peaches in a metal can in the summer when i was a kid and our extended family was all there, a proustian gift/curse which really ruined almost all peach ice cream for the rest of my life (my one exception is jeni&#39;s sweet cream biscuits and peach jam which isn&#39;t the same but gets me most of the way there).</p>
<p>it&#39;s one degree cooler today than it was yesterday and after today it&#39;s going to go back to normal temperatures. deborah was lying on the floor to maximize cooling and we were remembering the first apartment we lived in together my first year in indiana, which was two blocks from the back entrance of the hospital and which had a single weak air conditioner and (most importantly) whose windows faced the western sun which in the summer in the afternoon and evening in indiana was so incredibly fucking roasting hot.</p>
<p>that was also the first summer we got stoned together. i remember the very first time, sitting on the floor beside the bed after being apart for a while and opening this door into a new state of being together. deborah doesn&#39;t smoke anymore but this week i have been enjoying the weed strain blue dream, which i was introduced to by my friend n on a warm night in las vegas but hadn&#39;t had since. also i thought of a title for my drug memoir it&#39;s _the good lord bud.</p>
<p>_i had an all-time great mushroom trip saturday thanks to a variety of factors but i have to hand it to &quot;lemon tek&quot; which is grinding your mushrooms into a powder (i did more of a mince but tomato tomato) and then dripping lemon juice on them and letting it marinate and something something science you get more high. it says to do half of what you normally would but instead i did what i normally do plus a bit more for good measure and also i had run 12 miles that morning and so it was just a golden afternoon basking in the glow of serotonin.</p>
<p>i wish it hadn&#39;t taken a year but i&#39;m so happy to finally be on another team at work. i know it may just be a temporary honeymoon period thing and i don&#39;t want to jinx myself but i just generally feel much less agitation and stress at work on a daily basis (and when i feel them they&#39;re usually about like &quot;CSS is being annoying&quot; or &quot;why can&#39;t i get this test setup to work&quot; rather than messier and more intractable interpersonal and group dynamic problems). </p>
<p>my new manager (who i immediately connected with, i&#39;m so grateful when other people are fast talkers too) was talking about the assets that make this new team great and what she landed on it being a blessed combination of &quot;rapport&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; which i know sounds so #hahabusiness and like i am a stooge but i do think it&#39;s also kind of true and i&#39;m happy to feel like i can contribute to both those things and my contributions are appreciated and respected. </p>
<p>listening to the new noname album <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1RThtoZbeE7OQHMBzaBCJt?si=1z0MIZvGRvWaU21qtwyRsw&nd=1">sundial</a>,</em> which is incredible, like she is just so fucking good at rapping it&#39;s unbelievable_._ found my thank you note from literally <em>exactly</em> to the day seven years ago (💀) when i was first listening to <em>telefone:</em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;i&#39;m thankful for <em><a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/thankyounotes/thank-you-notes-8-15/5962425-soundcloud.com/noname/sets/telefone?c=5bcd248a-e4e1-444a-8e91-3e6f713d8451">telefone</a></em> by noname—i&#39;m thankful for chance&#39;s &quot;israel,&quot; which is the first song i remember hearing her on. i&#39;m thankful for the mellow ambient post-native tongues jazz-hop production, which is more in my favorite lane than <em>coloring book</em>. i&#39;m thankful for <em>reachin&#39; (a new refutation of time and space)</em> which i think is my all-time favorite summer album (i&#39;m thankful for my favorite track &quot;<a href="http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/thankyounotes/thank-you-notes-8-15/5962429-www.youtube.com/watch?c=5bcd248a-e4e1-444a-8e91-3e6f713d8451">where i&#39;m from</a>,&quot; which emits actual sunshine). i&#39;m thankful to remember a beautiful atypically cool summer day years ago where i ran down to the bottom edge of south beach and back up to my parents&#39; apartment while listening to that album on loop.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m thankful wayne is on this trippie redd song &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTdaTpoabR0">i&#39;m mad at me</a>&quot; the production of which has these cascading waters summer drum fills at the end of certain bars that remind me of i think just blaze and wayne&#39;s verse has a classic wayne line of &quot;she ain&#39;t A-OK / but it might be okay&quot; (also FYI that you can stream classic music documentary <em>the carter</em> <a href="https://watchdocumentaries.com/the-carter/">here</a>). reading the book <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125076611-the-visionaries">The Visionaries: Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil, and the Power of Philosophy in Dark Times</a></em>, which is a very pleasurable group bio / intellectual history thing if you like that and that time period (which i do and do)(fun fact i learned that simone weil tried to treat her chronic sinusitis with cocaine).</p>
<p>based on a recommendation from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/watching">watching newsletter</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite thing about “Killing It” is how aggressive it is. A lot of single-camera comedies are not ha-ha funny, or they back off their more prickly ideas in favor of tidy romantic love, or they become tediously moralizing or visibly therapized. None of these are vices per se, but en masse this style feels anemic and detached. Refreshingly, “Killing It” is indeed ha-ha funny, and it’s also filthy and brutal in exciting and surprising ways. I love “meditations on …” as much as anyone else — probably more! — but I also crave momentum, reality-based cynicism, explosive frustration and not just artful, teary monologues.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Start with Season 1. The show is completely serialized, and as a bonus, perhaps a full third of all living comedy performers appear at some point. If you like a good R-rated comedy and can tolerate violence against reptiles, this is a real treat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which really spoke to me, our dinner time show this week has been <em>killing it</em>, which is a comedy about craig robinson and claudia doherty being in a snake hunting contest in florida. because it&#39;s florida the show is as sweaty on that side of the camera as it is on this one, which feels right (though i also remember us binging the early seasons of <em>game of thrones</em> in that first oven of an apartment, a reminder that winter is always coming)</p>
