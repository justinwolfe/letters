      <div class="letter-body">
        <p>i‚Äôm thankful to be back on my ssri after having fallen off my regular schedule last week. i‚Äôm thankful that although this was painful, it added an increased sense of clarity as to why i take my ssri‚Äîto make my life just a little bit easier. i‚Äôm thankful to remember the fact that my therapist recommended trying an ssri on our fifth or sixth visit, but that i wouldn‚Äôt try 10mg for the first time for another year and a half. i‚Äôm thankful i took the step and got on it, even if i had to deal with a lot of shit from my doctor for starting it.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful i had to quickly learn that i could ask any doctor for a prescription and so when i didn‚Äôt meet with my doctor because of an unrelated ear problem, i asked her to refill my prescription and to up my dosage. i‚Äôm thankful she did, even if she did go against my wishes and call my mother to ask if it would be ‚Äúalright‚Äù for her adult son to have his dosage boosted. i‚Äôm thankful to remember how angry that made me; how absolutely demeaning it was‚Äînot to mention likely illegal. i‚Äôm thankful that even though a part of me told me to just not pickup the prescription because it was obtained inappropriately, i ignored that part of me.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful to be happy. i am happy. i‚Äôm thankful for how relieving that is to type and to say with confidence. i‚Äôm thankful that i can run my tongue over the scars in my mouth from where i‚Äôve bitten it‚Äîa tic of mine‚Äîand know that although some of the bites are fresh from the days where I wasn‚Äôt on my ssri, i don‚Äôt feel obligated to tear up my cheek. i‚Äôm thankful that although i feel some anxiety about the assignments i have coming up and the extreme difficulty of chinese‚Äînot to mention my yearning for french‚Äîi can still go out and think of other things.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that i‚Äôve developed a routine for a few of my days. i‚Äôm thankful for my thursdays where i have a standing date with a, a boy i‚Äôve been seeing for about a month now. i‚Äôm thankful for my fridays where i know i have services to look forward to. i‚Äôm thankful for saturdays which are research/study at the library days. sundays which are study at two different museums day. i‚Äôm thankful for how happy this schedule makes me and how it leaves me feeling less overwhelmed by free time.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful that yesterday, sunday, while i was sitting at my favorite of the two museums i like to study in, i got a snapchat from a. i‚Äôm thankful to have opened it and have seen a picture of myself. i‚Äôm thankful for the rush of almost terror that swept through me as i stared at the horribly out of focus blob that obviously was me. i‚Äôm thankful that the photo disappeared and that i replayed it. i‚Äôm thankful to have stared at it and then looked around confused, not seeing a. i‚Äôm thankful to have picked up my phone from the table i was sitting at and called a. i‚Äôm thankful for a‚Äôs teasing of, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what you mean, i can see you, but you can‚Äôt see me,‚Äù and so on. i‚Äôm thankful that he eventually appeared from a doorway and that i grinned upon seeing him, not expecting to see him. i‚Äôm thankful he sat with me while i traced chinese characters and ate lunch, telling me how he was here with his family who wanted to see an exhibit. i‚Äôm thankful for how he told me, ‚Äúi knew you‚Äôd be here, so i wanted to surprise you.‚Äù i‚Äôm thankful for the happiness that brought me and that when it came time for him to leave, i stood up and hugged him a goodbye. i‚Äôm thankful for the text i received from him after the first time i hugged him asking ‚Äúhow the hell‚Äù i was strong enough to have squeezed the air out of him. i laugh thinking of that.</p>
<p>i‚Äôm thankful for today, and i‚Äôm thankful for the week ahead. i hope you have a good day and at that, an even better week.</p>
