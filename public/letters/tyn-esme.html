        <p>I&#39;m thankful that my passport, issued in 2006, has expired and I now have <a href="https://instagram.com/p/BFj8LXTrBiI/">this picture</a> to send in for my new one. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that my old photo, taken when I was wrestling with an intense and debilitating eating disorder, exudes nothing but pain and sadness and literally looks nothing except the worst part of myself. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that I thought I was fooling everybody but when I look back on the old passport photo (there aren&#39;t a lot others because I either avoided cameras or destroyed physical copies of them) I don&#39;t know how I could have thought this. </p>
<p>What I see is a pallid complexion, slightly blotchy, with eyes that seem to not see the camera or care. My hair is pulled back, kind-of, with pieces dry, wavy, escaping. The most striking thing is how swollen my throat and neck is. One of the doctors said (and I&#39;ve never tried to verify this) that my body started adapting to how often I was throwing up- by trying to absorb calories in my throat. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that there are foods I cannot even begin to eat now because how much they were associated with my rules and were in high rotation on my list of &quot;&quot;Allowed Foods&quot;&quot;- things like fat-free wheat thins, campbell&#39;s vegetarian vegetable soup, microwave caramel apple popcorn, and any of those zero-calorie hazelnut creamers you add to coffee. (Bad coffee/ the smell of burnt coffee reminds me of the worst mornings.) Whole wheat pasta angel hair spaghetti and jarred pasta sauce- usually barilla, fat-free kraft american cheese singles, cold stone creamery birthday cake batter ice cream...I&#39;m thankful that J can&#39;t believe that I used to eat these things and ritually, if I ate at all. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that it took a few months after I realized I had a problem to really feel like I was out of control. I&#39;m thankful that because of the appetite suppression drugs I had illegally bought on the internet that I started having waking terrors. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for the one I had where someone was breaking into the one bedroom apartment I was watching for a friend that summer. I&#39;m thankful that when I opened my eyes and saw a man standing in the doorway, I put on my glasses. I&#39;m thankful that when he was still there, I ran at him with all my might, and my pillow, screaming &quot;&quot;Get the fuck out of my apartment!&quot;&quot;. I&#39;m thankful that I actually woke up when I ran, full-speed, into the closed door of the room, bending my glasses, bruising my cheek. I&#39;m thankful that I felt utterly insane. I&#39;m thankful that I felt utterly out of control. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for remembering sitting on the floor of the bedroom, my heart beating in a million tiny explosions out of my chest, lungs gasping against the combination of laughs and deep belly sobs that I knew I had to stop. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that the sun was rising, that I stayed up until it was surely up. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that recovery didn&#39;t happen immediately or in any sort of fairy-tale process. I&#39;m thankful that finding help was actually a more long and involved process than I imagined it could possibly be.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for the Specialist who told me, point blank, that without drugs I would never recover. I&#39;m thankful for his deep emphasis on NEVER. I&#39;m thankful for my brother going through the painful process of discovery that his chemistry/genetics/whatever is not suited to typical prescribed SSRIs. I&#39;m thankful that he went through the pain of the psych ward. I&#39;m thankful that because of chemistry/genetics/whatever that I should never take SSRIs. I&#39;m thankful that I had to recover without the aid of prescriptions they normally use as a go-to. I&#39;m thankful that mostly they didn&#39;t really know what to do with me because I was neither anorexic nor bulimic. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that there is far more information today for people who need help with ED-NOS diagnoses. I&#39;m thankful that they aren&#39;t looked upon strangely, like I felt I was, and are taken more seriously. I&#39;m thankful that there are far more options today. I&#39;m thankful that after about 12 different psychiatrists and psychologists, I found a woman who didn&#39;t wear shoes in her office and had a lot of plants in her windows who listened to me and said, &quot;&quot;It will be harder but it&#39;s possible...of course it&#39;s possible.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that 10 years later that I&#39;m not there anymore. That I&#39;m here. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that that girl sitting in that office didn&#39;t really think she&#39;d be around to see 2016 at all. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful to remember that and I&#39;m so thankful that I&#39;m here - I&#39;m so fucking thankful for that.</p>
<p>- esmé (5/18/16). esmeawright most places on the internet.</p>
