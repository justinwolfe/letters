<p>the word &quot;apricate&quot; which means &quot;to bask in the sun or sunbathe.&quot; as a person who has resisted sunscreen for sensory reasons my entire life having found the only sunscreen i have ever truly loved <a href="https://www.shiseido.com/us/en/clear-sunscreen-stick-spf-50-0730852169807.html?cgid=suncare">shiseido&#39;s clear sunscreen stick</a>. deborah catching a wave her first time boogie boarding. prescription sunglasses. rash guards.</p>

<p>uber driver in LA playing free jazz. hannah calling the dare STD soundsystem. somehow baffling myself i didn&#39;t have to pee on a five and a half hour flight, but thinking about it in my head i heard the song &quot;breaking the law&quot; by judas priest but the lyric was &quot;breaking the seal&quot;. for years now any time i am reminded of <em>the body keeps the score</em>, in my brain i immediately hear, to the tune of &quot;bodies&quot; by drowning pool, &quot;LET THE BODIES KEEP THE SCORE&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/api/images/168" alt="IMG_93B9F480D8BD-1.jpeg"></p>
<p>learning that our friends were concerned about deborah and i when we were out of town because we weren&#39;t posting to instagram that much which makes me feel seen 🥰 and also makes me feel seen 💀 (also: 9/11 jokes in the group chat). i thought our dyson vacuum had finally fully actually died because after charging it repeatedly it kept dying almost immediately and then i realized that the power toggle had been flipped to MAX and it can&#39;t do MAX for longer than 5 seconds even though at normal it&#39;s still enough to do most of the house on one battery.</p>

<p>trying to make myself write on a sunday night when i&#39;m not in the mood but also not <em>not</em> in the mood (but also don&#39;t really have sunday scaries this week, though we&#39;ll see how i feel after a full week back rather than just a half). realizing that though the title of the previous notes was &quot;i&#39;m good at all the narcissisms&quot; i had cut out the paragraph that contained that line to save for later, which is a list of books i read the last couple of weeks that you can now read:</p>
<p><em>hum</em> by helen phillips (literally everyone should read this short sci-fi novel about a mother who is laid off after training an AI to replace herself), <em>liars</em> by sarah manguso (while i find it wild that she does not have one friend with a not even happy but just not-horribly-fucked-up marriage, i also realized how i am #notallmen-ing and doing narcissism of small differences (i&#39;m good at all the narcissisms) and recognizing fucked up traces of my (🤞 not horribly-fucked-up) marriage and anyway regardless of the literal truth/&quot;emotional truth&quot; this book was impossible to put down and holy shit her ex-husband is psychotic!!!), <em>horror movie</em> by paul tremblay (deborah started reading this and i immediately pivoted because it&#39;s nice reading the same books—very entertaining horror novel about an imaginary film (<em>house of leaves</em> vibes but without like upside down pages)), <em>a city on mars</em> by kelly weinersmith (fun but not dumb pop-sci book about how impossible space settlement is), <em>bottoms up and the devil laughs</em> by kerry howley (amazing lyrical nonfiction about the american surveillance state) and <em>thrown</em> by kerry howley (because i liked her previous book so much i immediately followed it with this one, which is about MMA and phenomenology), <em>plane flying over a monster</em> by daniel saldaña paris (essays about how different spaces behave), and <em>health and safety</em> by emily witt (writing more about this soon). today i started the new novel from vigdis hjorth, <em>if only</em> which is good so far (her run-on free indirect prose enacting obsession)</p>
<p><img src="/api/images/167" alt="IMG_8287 2.jpg"></p>
<p>partial list of nice things people said to me since i came back to work on wednesday (which has been, predictably, perfectly fine): &quot;<em>Welcome back! You just got back and already brightened up the day</em> 🌞&quot;, &quot;<em>I wish (for my own sake) that you had to catch up on this much slack all the time cause the commentary is giving me life</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Though you are probably sad to be working again, I am happy to see you here again</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>oh man this is awesome thank you</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Huge, huge thanks to @justin for building the app</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>We are lucky you joined [new team] :dancing minion emoji:</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>omg i love you justin</em>&quot;</p>

<p>new season of <em>survivor</em> started and will now provide reliable serotonin every thursday dinner (the harbinger of the weekend). chasing the utter nothing waste of space that was this season of <em>love is blind UK</em> with <em>the secret lives of mormon wives</em> (hulu), which starts slow and is too short but absolutely hits starting with the girls trip in episode 4 and just keeps going from there, withdrawal from which has me trying watching a real housewives for the first time in probably a decade (also sarah hagi is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-recap-season-5-episode-1-costume-or-couture.html">recapping the current season</a> for vulture). </p>
<p><img src="/api/images/172" alt="IMG_8262.jpg"></p>
<p>after years of wondering, we finally got to see miso playing with another shiba inu (it was...not a success lmao). s.m. and l.d. were in town to see mitski and came over the night before for pizza and deborah&#39;s margaritas and we played around in the studio recording a song about tetris (success). the video game i have been playing the most lately is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt97Szjjls">peglin</a>, which i think can put my brain into an alpha wave better than those brain entrainment apps that i also still desperately use inside my noise-cancelling headphones. &quot;double bagging&quot; which is what i call putting foam earplugs in under my noise-cancelling headphones (i never wanna raw-dog anything except sex).</p>

<li><a href="https://buttondown.com/justinwolfe/archive/72217/">2017</a> (<em>to accept, though i have been trying to hold out on this new medicine, that it just seems to be making things worse, not just not ameliorating my anxiety but increasing it; this old elizabeth gumport essay about insomnia that s sent me; little yeti ching ching</em>)</li>
<li><a href="https://buttondown.com/justinwolfe/archive/922-4918/">2018</a> (<em>&quot;i&#39;m thankful, after an afternoon shower, for the drops of water jeweling the spiderwebs in the grass across the street&quot;</em>)</li>
