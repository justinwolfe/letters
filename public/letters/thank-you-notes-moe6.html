        <p>i&#39;m thankful i had my practice transfer viva today. i&#39;m thankful my colleagues and i call it a mini viva. i&#39;m thankful to realise that some of the fear i felt towards my supervisor have faded. i&#39;m thankful to have been practising power poses in the elevator on my way to her office. i&#39;m thankful i didn&#39;t notice it had stopped until a guy walked in. i&#39;m thankful to have hoped he didn&#39;t see me being silly. i&#39;m thankful that the way he winked at me when i got off let me know he saw me. i&#39;m thankful for how exasperated my supervisor was at me because i couldn&#39;t answer a lot of her questions. i&#39;m thankful for how angry i was at myself about not answering the questions right. i&#39;m thankful to have realised she was getting frustrated because she thought my big viva was this afternoon. i&#39;m thankful for her obvious relief when she found out it was next week. i&#39;m thankful that despite not being able to answer all the questions, i got some good pointers on what to research before the viva. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for j, my friend who i talk about a lot. i&#39;m thankful we met up on tuesday to talk about a church project we&#39;ll be working on from september. i&#39;m thankful for how easily we work together. i&#39;m thankful he suggested nando&#39;s for dinner because he knows it&#39;s my favorite and i have a loyalty card. i&#39;m thankful we ordered a full chicken to share because we were really hungry. i&#39;m thankful i reminded him to order the least spicy thing on the menu. i&#39;m thankful he tried to play it off. i&#39;m thankful i got him the hottest sauce for his chips and watched his face go red as he ate. i&#39;m thankful we talked about the practical aspects of the project. i&#39;m thankful we&#39;ve been planning the project for about a year now. i&#39;m thankful i stopped talking about the project a couple of months ago because i thought he was not interested in it anymore. i&#39;m thankful he asked if i still wanted to do the project. i&#39;m thankful to have said yes. i&#39;m thankful that even though we are very excited about it it will take a lot of work and a lot of difficult conversations. i&#39;m thankful one particular conversation will be really hard as it means we&#39;ll be leaving some of our dearest friends behind. i&#39;m thankful to hope the conversation goes well and we can stay in contact with our friends. i&#39;m thankful to remember the time when e, my friend told me i couldn&#39;t be friends with guys without falling in love with them. i&#39;m thankful to prove him wrong.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my graduation from leadership college last week. i&#39;m thankful i took the day off and spent sometime preparing myself both physically and mentally for an evening of smiling and having conversation. i&#39;m thankful for the lace top i ordered in a frenzy and wasn&#39;t sure it&#39;d look good. i&#39;m thankful it did look good paired with my polka dot full skirt. i&#39;m thankful that skirt makes me happy and reminds me of sound of music. i&#39;m thankful to have worn make-up for the first time this year. i&#39;m thankful to have worn contacts and left my glasses behind even though contacts gross me out. i&#39;m thankful for how different i felt to be dressed that way instead of my daily uniform of tee shirts and jeans. i&#39;m thankful to reinforce the stereotype of both scientists and PhD students in the way i dress. i&#39;m thankful for k, l and v who came along with me and had fun eating all the canapes and taking inappropiate photos in the photobooth. i&#39;m thankful that j (another one) who i really like was ordained as a reverend a couple of weeks ago. i&#39;m thankful to have walked up to him and congratulated him. i&#39;m thankful he turned around and complimented me, saying how good i looked and how great my fashion sense is. i&#39;m thankful to have started naming our future kids. i&#39;m thankful when j (friend) asked what i was going to do about my crush i said nothing. i&#39;m thankful there really is nothing i can do about it as he&#39;s neither on facebook or twitter. i&#39;m thankful to ignore the fact that i could actually just physically talk to him. i&#39;m thankful to realise i have about 6 js in my life. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful i got free tickets to &#39;the play that goes wrong&#39; yesterday. i&#39;m thankful for l, my flatmate who called and offered me the ticket. i&#39;m thankful to have seen it with e, j (another one) and l. i&#39;m thankful for how hard we laughed. i&#39;m thankful it was a nice thing in the midst of the craziness of my life and the world. i&#39;m thankful for new meds. i&#39;m thankful to not think about brexit, black lives matter, our new prime minister and the labor party and how everything is bent on self-destructing. i&#39;m thankful to be going to l&#39;s baby shower on saturday. i&#39;m thankful to hope she really enjoys hte pamper set i got her.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for how i&#39;ve become the office pop culture correspondent. i&#39;m thankful for how much joy it brings me to tell people about my reflections on pop culture. i&#39;m thankful that lunch time has become a time when i introduce my colleagues to something the cool kids say or do. i&#39;m thankful to have convinced a couple of them to sign up to twitter and recommended a couple of people for them to follow. i&#39;m thankful to not recommend my handle to them because my twitter is a different world and a different aspect of me i don&#39;t want them to experience. i&#39;m thankful for the hour i spent describing the kardashian empire to them today. i&#39;m thankful for f who always asks me to go to really cool documentaries of films the school of media studies puts on. i&#39;m thankful we&#39;re going to one about polyamory next week. i&#39;m thankful i get to work with some of the most intelligent but also fun people. </p>
