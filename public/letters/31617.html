        <p>i&#39;m thankful for the metrics tracking my performance at my new job. i&#39;m thankful that when i started this job, the idea of having metrics and their visibility and centrality made me uncomfortable, both because of a resistance to the ideology of using numbers to evaluate humans, which i find generally to be a disturbing trend, the fetishization of &quot;data&quot;, and also because personally i have always been wary of the psychological effects that awareness of metrics has on me—for example, i&#39;ve mostly stayed away from tracking my running speed and distance because i worry that doing so will turn running from a soul-enriching holistic activity to cells in a spreadsheet, an exercise in min-maxing.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful, though, for the most part, for the metrics tracking my performance at my new job. i&#39;m thankful to know that it&#39;s easy to be thankful for the metrics because i&#39;m usually hitting the target expectations set by my team lead, but i&#39;m thankful regardless. i&#39;m thankful for the reason that i&#39;m thankful, at my old job, at the end of a hard day full of hard conversations, i often wouldn&#39;t have anything tangible or concrete to show for my day, just the general feeling of exhaustion. i&#39;m thankful that now, at the end of a hard day full of hard conversations, i have a number i can hang my hat on, that i can look at that number and say &quot;<em>okay, i did this many things today</em>&quot; and take a kind of solace in that, even if i am exhausted.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that last night after finishing my day&#39;s work at my job and receiving my number, i played the VR game <em>job simulator</em>, in which you simulate jobs. i&#39;m thankful for the level i played, in which you are a short-order cook who has to assemble a number of ridiculous dishes for a restaurant full of floating robots. i&#39;m thankful for the sensation of preparing a cup of tea in VR (filling the kettle, boiling the water in the kettle, getting a mug from the cupboard, putting a tea bag in the mug)—i&#39;m thankful for the way that it defamiliarizes the action and reminds me of how amazing preparing a mug of tea is in the real world, how it is made up of these component movements and actions which we have internalized so much that they pass in a blur. i&#39;m thankful to hope that virtual reality, which seems on the face of things like an escape from the world as it is, could actually provide a path toward greater appreciation of that world and enhance our presentness inside it. i&#39;m thankful that i spent probably a good minute opening and closing the door of the virtual microwave, just for the satisfaction of the feeling of doing so.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the strange sense in virtual reality of both having and not having a body. i&#39;m thankful that more than traditional video games, VR reflects the movements of your body in a 1:1 way—as you turn your head left, your character turns their head left and you see what is to the left of you; if you step to the right, your character steps to the right; if you lift your arm, your character lifts their arm. i&#39;m thankful that this makes even standing in the <em>tron</em>-like light grid while waiting for a game to load feel compelling in and of itself a way that flat, static traditional loading screens never do. i&#39;m thankful, though, that even as VR enhances your feeling of embodiment from one angle, it (at least in its current incarnation and in the games i&#39;ve played) also reduces it in another way.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful this is because VR is only tracking the movements of your head and your hands and so in the virtual world, you are just a head and a pair of hands—if you look down in your body, you just see empty space. i&#39;m thankful that this could be disturbing, but as i was playing last night, felt liberating. i&#39;m thankful that though i have always felt i am bad at dancing and have felt uncomfortable in situations that require me to dance in public and done everything i can to avoid them, last night, in the virtual reality kitchen, there was a boom box and i inserted a CD into the boom box and started the music playing, mostly just to see what would happened. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that as i cooked and as the music played, i found myself dancing along with the the music, first slightly but with increasing gusto. i&#39;m thankful that though dancing in the real world feels uncomfortable because i feel ungainly, like my body isn&#39;t moving in the correct way, because in the game i couldn&#39;t see my body, didn&#39;t <em>have</em> a body, just a head (which i bobbed) and hands (which i swayed and swooped) i could concentrate on feeling the music and letting it work on me in a way that has always felt difficult. i&#39;m thankful for the release of that after a hard day full of hard conversations. i&#39;m thankful for the slight but sweet satire of the love song playing in the virtual world, the chorus of which was &quot;<em>i [emotion] you</em>.&quot; i&#39;m thankful to have a body but i&#39;m also thankful to not have a body.</p>
