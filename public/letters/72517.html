        <p>i&#39;m thankful that at the bike shop i got a new tube for the one i burst, learned i have been severely underinflating my tubes on the reg, and ordered newer more durable tires. i&#39;m thankful that while they changed the tube i went to the library and returned some magazines i checked out but mostly didn&#39;t read. i&#39;m thankful while out to have gotten a text from d with a screenshot of a text from our landlord saying she would be by in half an hour to drop off a new dishwasher for us (our dishwasher has not worked for most of the time we lived here, which honestly was fine with us) and that if we weren&#39;t there she would put it on the back stoop. i&#39;m thankful that when i got back with my bike it was on the back stoop and that while it was annoying to move it wasn&#39;t insane like the time our landlord got us a new oven and we had to move that in ourselves and move the other one out of the house into the graveyard of dead appliances in our &quot;garage&quot;.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for the moment in <em>the keepers</em> last night where a woman talks about how her deceased husband, before he died, had a plan to murder her abuser and would have gone through with it had she convinced him not to and d said something about how it was nice he had planned to murder him and then we had a conversation about how i&#39;ve imagined that i would kill someone for her but it&#39;s always in impromptu settings like if they broke into our house or in the zombie apocalypse versus like premeditated murder though i think i&#39;d probably still do it (i&#39;m thankful to hope that this is not used in a trial someday). i&#39;m thankful for our affection for the old medical examiner featured in the most recent episode who was pretty adorable. i&#39;m thankful that in a shot of one of the main investigators at her home, we saw that she had a fast food restaurant style trash can (like big and blocky and with &quot;THANKS&quot; inlaid into a hinged piece of wood you push in to stuff the trash), which was <em>bizarre</em> but also kind of endearing.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/ddillingworth/status/888197355089960960">this letter virginia woolf wrote to her mother</a> when she was six years old. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/hhnnccnnll/status/889745464073101314">hegel&#39;s weird take</a> on stars being astral rashes. i&#39;m thankful for jengotch, who is one of my favorite people to watch on instagram stories—i&#39;m thankful generally for how great her comic timing and general affect are and am thankful specifically yesterday for her comparison of her moles to chocolate chips and her discussions of trying to locate her sexiness. i&#39;m thankful for a good <a href="https://twitter.com/kidd_kong78/status/889392540172120064">single shot scene</a>, especially when it involves dogs and french fries. i&#39;m thankful that though <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/889672379139575809">it probably makes me a psychopath</a>, i honestly do think i would make a really good cult leader. i&#39;m thankful for haribo sour gold-bears, which i think i would make a sacramental food for my cult because they are, d and i have decided, a perfect candy. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VsmF9m_Nt8">this insane and wonderful song</a> e introduced me to, which i would make a hymn. 
 </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://twitter.com/fakeirl/status/889660758891663362">this important discussion</a> about the thing i hate most about going to the movies. i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s description of how her experience of going to see one of the <em>chronicles of narnia</em> movies was tainted because she was thinking the whole time about how much she had to pee but didn&#39;t go. i&#39;m thankful on a call with my parents last night to have remembered how when my grandmother had dementia but was still living alone in a retirement community and had an upstairs guest room, she would always ask her guests if they wanted to &quot;take a pot&quot; with them upstairs (i.e. a literal pot to piss in), which always weirded everyone out but in a way made sense since when she was young that was a thing people still literally did. i&#39;m thankful for how crazy time is and to imagine that probably in a hundred years someone will think of me lying in bed tapping plastic buttons on this big piece of metal and glass as as weird as using a chamber pot. i&#39;m thankful that my parents and i agreed that while my mom would be good at living in the past, my dad and i would not be good at it.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that later last night right before we went to bed d was texting with her sister, who has many complex online friendships, and her sister was telling her about a friend who confessed that he has a pee/diaper fetish. i&#39;m thankful, right before we went to sleep, when i would usually say something like &quot;good night i love you&quot; to d i instead said something about diapers and she said &quot;<em>say something else to me so that&#39;s not the last thing you say to me before i fall asleep</em>&quot; and i&#39;m thankful that though i initially took this as a challenge and said nothing, i eventually did say something (&quot;<em>good night, sweet prince</em>&quot;, which is something that&#39;s often the last thing i say to her before she goest to bed and which is still weird but much sweeter than whatever i said about diapers), though it turns out she had weird dreams anyway. i&#39;m thankful that i can&#39;t imagine why anyone who lives with me would ever have weird dreams (i&#39;m thankful for sarcasm).</p>
