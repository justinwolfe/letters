        <p>i&#39;m thankful to report to you that i stayed in a stupid, grumpy mood for most of the day yesterday, despite really trying to be in a better mood. i&#39;m thankful to know that sometimes trying is not enough and i am not a robot who can switch the value of some variable in my brain from &quot;sad&quot; to &quot;happy,&quot; even though i don&#39;t like to be in a bad mood and sometimes i wish it was that easy. i&#39;m thankful to still feel a bit grumpy this morning but to mostly feel better. i&#39;m thankful that we went to see <em>get out</em>, which was very good. i&#39;m thankful that we had lunch at wendy&#39;s, which was full of happy old people doing their sunday socializing. i&#39;m thankful that it was warm enough for us to eat outside in the sun. i&#39;m thankful for the rolleroaster hills of the country roads we went down (and up) on our way to the house where we are house-sitting next week. i&#39;m thankful to have forgotten that the owners have cats and to hope that taking loads of benadryl will make life there okay. i&#39;m thankful that their dog likes d and i and we like their dog. i&#39;m thankful to have never cared for real chickens (i&#39;m thankful that d compared our life next week to <em>stardew valley</em>), which i think will be an interesting experience.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d made vermont curry in our new instant pot. i&#39;m thankful, since i don&#39;t like vermont curry, that the curry was for her lunches this week at work and to swap with a coworker/friend who she wants to do a lunch swap with. i&#39;m thankful, since i don&#39;t like vermont curry and d doesn&#39;t get to eat it very often, that she is getting to eat it now. i&#39;m thankful to remind myself to stop making rude comments about the instant pot, which i was predisposed to dislike for stupid and arbitrary reasons. i&#39;m thankful that when she was starting to cook, she realized that we didn&#39;t have carrots as i had said we did when we went to the grocery store on saturday and she considered buying carrots. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that it was warm outside and i biked over to the grocery store to buy two carrots, which cost 61 cents. i&#39;m thankful that on the way back home, more than halfway there, i let the grocery bag hit my wheel, which ripped the bag and spilled the carrots onto the ground. i&#39;m thankful to have started home but then, not sure whether d would accept the carrots and not wanting to make a whole extra trip, turned around and went back to the store. i&#39;m thankful that at the crosswalk, i accidentally dropped the carrots (which had broken into chunks) because of the ripped bag and i&#39;m thankful to have awkwardly had to put my bike in a ditch so that i could run back into the crosswalk and get the carrots and carry them to the garbage can. i&#39;m thankful to have locked up my bike and gotten two new carrots and come home. i&#39;m thankful for d&#39;s appreciation for the carrots.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have made burritos for dinner and to have had chocolate chip cookies d made for dessert. i&#39;m thankful for the episodes of <em>terrace house</em> we watched during and after dinner, which were fucking <em>crazy</em>. i&#39;m thankful to have spent some time after dinner working on textexpander snippets that will hopefully make me more productive at work this week. i&#39;m thankful for textexpander&#39;s menu option, which makes it possible for me to call a group of snippets with a single shortcut and choose the one i want from a dropdown rather than having to remember the shortcut for every single one of them. i&#39;m thankful for applescript, which i had never really used before and which has interesting syntax. i&#39;m thankful to have the standard monday apprehension about going back to work but to mostly feel good about going back and excited to learn more. </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that the recyclables were pretty easy to sort this week. i&#39;m thankful that though my tablet died in the middle of my treadmill run yesterday because of a broken USB plug, i still got a decent run in and bought a new set of USB charging cables. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRRd-gzhVsk/">nathan fielder</a>. i&#39;m thankful that there is <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/165461/Aim-high-and-you-wont-shoot-your-foot-off-Phyllis-Diller">an archive of 50,000 jokes</a> by phyllis diller and <a href="https://transcription.si.edu/phyllis-diller-cards?utm_source=nmah_blog">you can help transcribe it</a>, which might be a soothing thing to do. i&#39;m thankful to have dipped back into <em>parable of the talents</em>, which i had paused because it got too real. i&#39;m thankful that i <a href="https://twitter.com/AlannaBennett/status/836949206111830016">never doubt rihanna</a>. i&#39;m thankful for the christian biker gang we saw out on a sunday drive yesterday.</p>
