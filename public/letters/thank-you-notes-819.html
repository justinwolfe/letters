        <p>i&#39;m thankful for &quot;killing me softly with his song,&quot; both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69VrOmd7qNc">the fugees version</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OyM0R5uRPQ">the roberta flack version</a>. i&#39;m thankful in the fugees version how that weird little sample from &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6oO-1iWc1c">bonita applebaum</a>&quot; is plugged in for some reason. i&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to listen to the new frank ocean album this weekend. i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QZn9xiuOE">let&#39;s get it on</a>,&quot; which i know is played and obvious, but is one of the most joyful and lush recordings ever and one that i will never tire of listening to. i&#39;m thankful that the spirit moves me, so i let it groove me. i&#39;m thankful it&#39;s something like sanctified.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that yesterday work was hectic but ended pretty well. i&#39;m thankful that when our chat app went down for a while, the customers who had to wait for a response were mostly very helpful. i&#39;m thankful to have felt like a l33t h@xx0r using terminal to start up a local server to use a backend utility one of my coworkers built. i&#39;m thankful to have gotten along really well with the new team member who was shadowing me and thankful to have been able to teach him a lot of helpful things. i&#39;m thankful that he is thoughtful and nice and committed and that i think he&#39;ll be a really great addition to our team.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for chocolate cake batter flavored protein powder. i&#39;m thankful for pepper jack cheese sticks. i&#39;m thankful that d reseasoned our leftovers last night and made them even better than they had been the night before (i&#39;m thankful to have them again tonight). i&#39;m thankful for the cherry tomatoes for her garden, which are so flavorful. i&#39;m thankful that while a lot of the summer fruits are already gone, nectarines are still plentiful and delicious. i&#39;m thankful to have found some decaf chai tea i had brewed a while ago in the back of the fridge and to have drunk it after dinner. i&#39;m thankful for cold drinks on hot days. i&#39;m thankful i made more tea before bed last night and thankful that after i finish writing these notes, i&#39;ll put it in the fridge to chill. i&#39;m thankful for glass bottles.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have facetimed with my parents and my brother and his girlfriend, who are visiting them for a few days. i&#39;m thankful my brother&#39;s girlfriend is a lovely person and that she had the remnants of purple hair dye in her ice blonde hair, which added a cool sheen. i&#39;m thankful to have talked about video games with my brother, about how he&#39;s playing <em>majora&#39;s mask</em> for the nth time but has never actually beat it. i&#39;m thankful that my brother&#39;s dog, who they thought was going to die soon, seems to be doing well; i&#39;m thankful that our family dog has cancer and is going to die soon, but doesn&#39;t seem to be in pain right now and is getting spoiled by my parents with delicious treats and love. i&#39;m thankful to have listened to them all trying to agree on what takeout to order for dinner and to have heard that my dad&#39;s optometrist told him that he should not look at a computer screen as much as he does and that he seems like he may take her advice seriously.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful for my mom&#39;s subtle (and not so subtle) pressure for me to come home and visit them is just an example of how much she loves me and d and loves spending time with us. i&#39;m thankful for that. i&#39;m thankful to remember a very striking moment in one of the <em>up</em> series documentaries that has stuck with me, where someone describes how it feels like such a trial, with a career and a family, to be able to take a trip to visit her parents once or twice a year, but how as her parents get older, she&#39;s struck by how paltry that number feels, that if she does her very best to arrange her schedule see them twice a year, that still might mean she only sees them twenty or thirty times more before they die. i&#39;m thankful to remind myself of that, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_the_Goon_Squad">time&#39;s a goon</a>, and thankful also for how technology helps to bridge distances. i&#39;m thankful for &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77R1Wp6Y_5Y">telephone line</a>&quot; by ELO (i know i&#39;ve been thankful for it before, but i&#39;m still thankful for it, the heavenly falsetto chorus, the walking bass line, strings that touch the clouds).</p>
