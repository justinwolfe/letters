        <p>i&#39;m thankful on vacation to have fulfilled my long-held dream of taking drugs before going to an amusement park. i&#39;m thankful for the surprising strength of the edibles we packed i&#39;m thankful for universal studios, which i had not been to in more than a decade (probably closer to two) and which was a strange place to spend a day with family. i&#39;m thankful for my favorite ride, which was probably the simpsons themed one, which was great because you got to watch <em>the simpsons</em> while standing in line. i&#39;m thankful for the strangeness of all the queues, which made me think about kafka and minimalist art.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that d suggested we watch the movie <em>the house</em> with my parents the other night, since it was surprisingly funny and while it makes me uncomfortable as a child to watch a movie with my parents about the things that parents do for their children, i think it made them happy and it was funny enough most of the time i could ignore the discomfort. i&#39;m thankful for how strange it is to be someone&#39;s child, how, though my parents are wonderful and i have a great and relatively uncomplicated relationship with them, i still feel, when i am with them, like a different person, a self who is not the self i am now, which is hard to deal with at times. i&#39;m thankful now that i&#39;m back home to feel like my actual self. i&#39;m thankful for the little boy on our flight who asked if his suitcase was &quot;in the belly of the plane.&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that my brother and his wife are still addicted to pokemon go, which is kind of adorable (and also ridiculous). i&#39;m thankful for their dog, who is probably going to have to be put to sleep soon but is very sweet. i&#39;m thankful that they and d and i played <em>overcooked</em> together, which was frantic and fun. i&#39;m thankful that though my family likes watching lots of television that i not only am not interested in watching, but find actively annoying (like marathons of <em>that 70s show</em> (HONESTLY) or various _modern family-_inspired weepfests), we share a love of <em>nathan for you</em> and we all got hooked on the first season of <em>90 day fiance</em> after i read <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/90-day-fiance-tlc-best-show.html">sarah&#39;s piece about it</a>. i&#39;m thankful for their really really nice DVR/cable box, which made me jealous even though i think it would probably be a bad idea for d and i to have cable TV at home.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that my doctor&#39;s appointment today was perfunctory. i&#39;m thankful that because it was raining and she didn&#39;t have work and we needed to go to the grocery store after, d came along. i&#39;m thankful that my blood pressure, which used to cause me such anxiety about every appointment, is regularly good now. i&#39;m thankful that my doctor was wearing knee high black leather boots and that when i complimented them, she made a joke about being a biker on the weekend and then clarified that she had never been on a motorcycle. i&#39;m thankful that she wagged her finger mischievously when we discussed my medication problems and said &quot;<em>you&#39;re a tricky one</em>!&quot; </p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i have my medication appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow. i&#39;m thankful that i have felt stable and have been mostly sleeping better back on the prozac, but that it&#39;s still not really doing what i need it to do (which is the reason i tried the other terrible (for me) medicines in the first place). i&#39;m thankful to be hopeful that we will find something better for me to try (i&#39;m thankful that d switched medications recently and has been happy with the results). i&#39;m thankful that though i ate poorly on vacation (in terms of health, in terms of satisfaction it was great), my stomach seems pretty okay. i&#39;m thankful to get back into my normal daily routines.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to have not used a computer since last tuesday but i&#39;m thankful to be back using one now. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Functional-Development-Redux-ebook/dp/B071HB1526/ref=pd_sim_351_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=HNZYMED8GFYYZDEB6CSR&dpID=51ZA-7GbsVL&preST=_SY445_QL70_&dpSrc=detail">this book on react</a> that i have been reading so that i can do more interesting projects at work (where we use react for lots of important things). i&#39;m thankful to slowly be getting more comfortable with ES6 syntax, even though it still  looks &quot;wrong&quot; to me a lot of the time. i&#39;m thankful to have read the first part of gene wolfe&#39;s <em>the fifth head of cerebrus</em>, which was very engaging, even though i&#39;m having trouble getting into the second part. i&#39;m thankful for this group biography of the frankfurt school, which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grand-Hotel-Abyss-Frankfurt-School-ebook/dp/B01A4APN6G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1508781378&sr=1-1&keywords=grand+hotel+abyss+the+lives+of+the+frankfurt+school">deeply discounted</a> and which i am looking forward to reading. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/314763/Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg-Pun-Costume-Ideas">this list of ruth bader ginsburg costume pun ideas</a>.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i took tomorrow off work in addition to today. i&#39;m thankful that it is raining outside and we have the windows open to let fresh air into the house. i&#39;m thankful that it is cool but not yet cold. i&#39;m thankful for candles that attempt to represent the smells of fall in wax. i&#39;m thankful for the experience of striking a match to ignite it and then lighting a wick, for that small window of time where you can&#39;t tell if the wick is lit or if it&#39;s just the flame of the match, the two seem like the same thing, but then the second flame grows and you know that it&#39;s lit.</p>
