        <p>i&#39;m thankful to be hopeful that i will not spend part of today in a shitty mood as i have every other day of vacation. i&#39;m thankful for the shitty irony of being in a shitty mood for at least part of every day of the vacation i have been desperately looking forward to for weeks. i&#39;m thankful that at least yesterday i was only in a shitty mood for a few hours in the evening and spent most of the day on the beach pleasantly reading beside d and not being in a shitty mood. i&#39;m thankful that d said &quot;the ocean is calming&quot; and thankful that i agreed. i&#39;m thankful that we borrowed my parents&#39; beach umbrella, which made it possible for us to stay out on the beach much longer and in much more pleasant conditions than we had the previous day. i&#39;m thankful for the feeling of stabbing the umbrella stand into the sand and twisting it in so that it&#39;s loduged securely, a stable base.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that my parents took us out to dinner last night, even though dinner was kind of a trigger for my shitty mood. i&#39;m thankful that my parents, who have never had korean bbq, wanted to share korean bbq with d and i, who eat it often in bloomington and love it. i&#39;m thankful for the ludicrous and ludicrously overpriced south beach restaurant&#39;s take on korean barbeque, even though it was lame as fuck. i&#39;m thankful for my outrage at the absence of panchan and ssamjang and other essential elements of korean bbq; i&#39;m thankful for the flavorless dipping sauces and how bullshit it was that they don&#39;t let you cook your own bulgogi and thankful for the dish which encapsulated the scam nature of the evening, which was a $15 order of shrimp that included literally exactly six naked un-dressed shrimp on a ceramic tray. i&#39;m thankful that i was able to talk about my outrage at how bullshit this all was with my parents without offending them but instead by being offended on their behalf.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that i was mostly left alone to be in my shitty mood as we walked back to the car after dinner and drove home. i&#39;m thankful that i was able to exit my shitty mood for long enough to watch an episode of <em>the office</em> and eat chocolate ice cream with whipped cream with my family. i&#39;m thankful that the ice cream was very tasty and am thankful that my dad got up halfway through his bowl to get more whipped cream. i&#39;m thankful that i went to the grocery store with my mom yesterday and got all of the sweet treats that my dad loves and doesn&#39;t normally get to eat. i&#39;m thankful for oreos, for tiny powdered donuts, for apple jacks and corn pops, for whipped cream. i&#39;m thankful to have watched my mom play <em>journey</em>, which she found enchanting if difficult. i&#39;m thankful to have guided her through difficult parts and am thankful to know that when she tells me incredibly obvious mom things like &quot;<em>try walking on the shady side of the street so you don&#39;t get too hot on the way to the drugstore</em>&quot; and that annoys me, she is only telling me them because she loves me.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful that my parents love me and i love them and they love d and d loves them. i&#39;m very thankful for that, which, because it&#39;s never been in question, is something that i have a tendency to take for granted. i&#39;m thankful that they want to spend so much time with us, even though sometimes so much is too much time for me, depending on the shittiness of my mood. i&#39;m thankful that the biggest problem i have on vacation is being in a shitty mood for mostly arbitrary and small glitches of brain chemistry, since i could have much bigger problems. i&#39;m thankful to have learned from <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/87/13/1308.full">this sad essay</a> that robin williams and his wife said &quot;<em>goodnight, my love</em>&quot; to each other every night before bed, which is the same thing d and i say to each other every night before bed.</p>
<p>i&#39;m thankful to know that i can only control my feelings so much and sometimes all i can do when i&#39;m visited by a shitty mood is sit it out, as frustrating as that is, and wait for it to end. i&#39;m thankful that though i&#39;m in a shitty mood right now, i know that my shitty mood will eventually end, at least temporarily, and will probably do so sooner than later. i&#39;m thankful to have the small hope that i will spend less of today in a shitty mood than i spent yesterday. i&#39;m thankful to have achievable goals for my vacation. i&#39;m thankful for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj2h_GcmsHPAhWEpx4KHeq9DnEQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F02%2Farts%2Fmusic%2Fsteve-reich-at-80-still-plugged-in-still-plugging-away.html&usg=AFQjCNFeXqkh0VrsIIJcC0rDApYHeZg1kQ&bvm=bv.134495766,d.dmo">the <em>new york times</em> article</a> about how steve reich&#39;s yoga practice has informed his music. i&#39;m thankful, since i haven&#39;t done yoga in several days, to do it today.</p>
