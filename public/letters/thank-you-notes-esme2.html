        <p>2/29:
I&#39;m thankful for the East River Ferry. I&#39;m thankful for the 34th street dock that is bathed in sunlight and even though there&#39;s a strong winter-tinged wind now, I&#39;m warm. I&#39;m thankful that it reminds me of being a lizard and and how hard it must be to not have warm blood. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for my blood that poured from the mosquito-like needle into 6 different vials in a windowless room a few blocks from here. I&#39;m thankful for the woman who told me I looked cute and kept calling me &quot;&quot;sugar&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;baby&quot;&quot; and how gentle she was when she stuck my right arm. I&#39;m thankful she didn&#39;t think I was strange for commenting on how easy it seemed and for how she reminded me that not so long ago not all needles were efficient or disposable. I&#39;m thankful for people in the past who had to sterilize needles and for how much easier plastic makes some things.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that I remembered to text X while I was waiting and that he came down from his neurobiology lab to have lunch with me in the cafeteria of the hospital. I&#39;m thankful for how modern and well-lit the whole place was and for his hug and for how seeing someone in a brand-new location is sometimes strange. I&#39;m thankful that my sideways-stomach nervous feeling dissipated immediately when he hugged me. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for ramen and how even not so good ramen is comforting and good ramen is exquisite and that the ramen we had fell somewhere smack in the middle. I&#39;m thankful it was on the healthier side of most ramen. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that X said that he&#39;d come and keep J company on Thursday when I&#39;m in surgery and how that somehow helped make me feel best about this whole thing. I like the thought of them in this clean cafeteria eating slightly better than mediocre ramen while I&#39;m somewhere upstairs in a bright room, unconscious. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful to have met X though J and that they both have these steady scientific minds that compliment mine when it&#39;s being unruly..</p>
<p>4/1:</p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for a fast surgery and for the simple kindness of everyone associated with my doctor. I&#39;m thankful for everyone knocking on the door and bustling in and out every 3 seconds yesterday and everyone asking me the same first three verification questions &quot;&quot;spell your last name&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;spell your first name&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;what&#39;s your date of birth&quot;&quot;- I&#39;m thankful that I forgot how to spell jennifer because I haven&#39;t been that name since 2006 and I&#39;m thankful for the reminder of the opportunity to have been someone else and to have made the active choice to become who I truly am. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for the reaction everyone has when the find out my birth name and that they all seem so surprised. I&#39;m thankful to be more an esmé than a jennifer. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that everyone was kind and patient and that the anesthesiologist asked what I worried about promised me nothing bad would happen. I&#39;m thankful that he seemed to break the doctor protocol when he did that, because they&#39;re not really supposed to promise that, are they? I&#39;m thankful that he let me wear my grey beanie underneath the blue mesh head cover because I said it made me feel safer. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that they told me to think about the best dream I&#39;ve ever had as they held the oxygen to my face and I couldn&#39;t think of anything. I&#39;m thankful for the deep blues and greens and slow motion swimming I did before I came to in the recovery area. I&#39;m thankful for the nurse being so kind and the anesthesiologist being there again and winking at me over the fact that I still had the beanie on when they took of the blue mesh head cover. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful that I don&#39;t really remember much except desperately wanting water. I hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything since before midnight the day before and it was after 11am. I&#39;m thankful for the humour that the nurse found in my deep desire for just water even though they had a myriad of options. I&#39;m thankful for their ice chips that were easily crunchy and how they made the water perfectly cold. I&#39;m thankful for j&#39;s (what I think was) amusement as they let him stay with me for 5 minutes because I don&#39;t remember what I said or really much until they had me sitting up across the room. I&#39;m thankful that when I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing it usually leans silly....</p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for cab drivers who know exactly where they&#39;re going and for sleeping away the afternoon. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for cabin fever and for going for a slow walk to transmitter park with j and for laughing and for all the flowers and leaves and colors that are just that looming spring on all the doorsteps. I&#39;m thankful for the boys in capes dancing to the phantom of the opera underneath the willow tree at the park and for my reaction to j&#39;s gentle laughter at them, that maybe &quot;&quot;they&#39;re just living their best life.&quot;&quot; I&#39;m thankful for j&#39;s real laughter when I say something he likes. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for Paulie Gee&#39;s Pizza and that every single time we go there, Paulie is there in his ball cap clutching his oslo coffee cup happy as can be. I&#39;m thankful to think about how nice it must be to make good pizza for a living. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful to finally start reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as a semi-drugged out state in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I&#39;m thankful for the street names that have remained the same, and that in my state I could only vaguely place them in the map of my mind. </p>
<p>I&#39;m thankful for that map and for this place that feels so much like home. </p>
<p>- esmé (2/29, 4/1).</p>
