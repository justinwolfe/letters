# Architectural Changes Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Changes Implemented**: Reader App Frontend/Backend Separation

## Overview

Implemented Task 4.3 from the REFACTORING_ROADMAP.md: **Separate Reader Frontend/Backend**. This change provides a clean architectural separation between the Express API server and the React frontend application.

## What Changed

### Directory Structure

**Before:**

```
apps/reader/
├── index.ts              # Monolithic server + API routes
├── src/                  # React app
├── vite.config.ts       # Vite config
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript config
└── dist/                # Built frontend
```

**After:**

```
apps/reader/
├── server/              # Backend (Express API)
│   ├── index.ts        # Server entry point
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── emails.ts   # Email endpoints
│   │   └── images.ts   # Image serving
│   └── middleware/
│       ├── error.ts    # Error handling
│       └── logging.ts  # Request logging
├── client/             # Frontend (React + Vite)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   ├── App.css
│   │   └── main.tsx
│   ├── dist/           # Built frontend
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   └── tsconfig.json
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

### Files Created

1. **`apps/reader/server/index.ts`** - New server entry point

   - Cleaner, more modular structure
   - Uses route modules and middleware
   - Health check endpoint
   - Improved error handling

2. **`apps/reader/server/routes/emails.ts`** - Email API routes

   - All email-related endpoints
   - Search functionality
   - Navigation endpoints
   - Random email endpoint

3. **`apps/reader/server/routes/images.ts`** - Image API routes

   - Embedded image serving
   - Proper caching headers

4. **`apps/reader/server/middleware/error.ts`** - Error handling middleware

   - Global error handler
   - 404 not found handler

5. **`apps/reader/server/middleware/logging.ts`** - Request logging middleware

   - Logs all HTTP requests
   - Duration tracking
   - Status code logging

6. **`apps/reader/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Architecture explanation
   - Development guide
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Troubleshooting section

### Files Modified

1. **`package.json`**

   - Updated `reader:dev` to work with new client directory
   - Updated `reader:build` to work with new client directory
   - Updated `reader:server` to use new server entry point
   - Updated `dev` script name labels (backend→server, frontend→client)

2. **`tsconfig.json`** (root)

   - Added `apps/reader/client/**/*` to exclusions
   - Prevents TypeScript from type-checking React code with Node config

3. **`apps/reader/client/vite.config.ts`**
   - Cleaned up configuration
   - Removed deprecated options

### Files Deleted

1. **`apps/reader/index.ts`** - Old monolithic server file (replaced by `server/index.ts`)

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**

   - Server code handles data and business logic
   - Client code handles presentation and user interaction

2. **Independent Development**

   - Frontend and backend can be worked on separately
   - Each has its own configuration and dependencies

3. **Better Organization**

   - Related code grouped together
   - Easier to navigate and understand
   - Follows standard Express.js patterns

4. **Scalability**

   - Easy to add new routes
   - Easy to add new middleware
   - Easy to add new frontend components

5. **Independent Deployment**
   - Frontend can be deployed to a CDN
   - Backend can scale independently
   - Different deployment strategies possible

## Development Workflow

### Development Mode (Recommended)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts both backend server (port 3000) and Vite dev server (port 5173) with hot reload.

### Backend Only

```bash
npm run reader:server
```

### Frontend Dev Server Only

```bash
npm run reader:dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run reader
```

Builds the frontend and starts the production server.

## API Documentation

### Email Endpoints

- `GET /api/emails` - List all published emails
- `GET /api/emails/search?q=query` - Search emails
- `GET /api/emails/random` - Get random email
- `GET /api/emails/:id` - Get email by ID
- `GET /api/emails/:id/navigation` - Get prev/next links

### Image Endpoints

- `GET /api/images/:id` - Get embedded image

### Health Check

- `GET /health` - Server health status

## Type Safety

- Server code uses root `tsconfig.json` (Node.js types)
- Client code uses `apps/reader/client/tsconfig.json` (React + DOM types)
- No type conflicts between server and client

## Verification

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

✅ No errors related to the reader app refactoring

### Build

```bash
npm run reader:build
```

✅ Client builds successfully to `apps/reader/client/dist/`

## Future Improvements

Based on the refactoring roadmap, next steps could include:

1. **Shared API Client Package** (from Phase 4)

   - Create `packages/api-client/` for type-safe API requests
   - Share between frontend and potential future clients

2. **Event System** (from Phase 4)

   - Implement event emitter for real-time updates
   - WebSocket support for live notifications

3. **Full-Text Search with FTS5** (from Phase 4)
   - Improve search performance with SQLite FTS5
   - Better relevance ranking

## Notes

- The old `apps/reader/dist/` directory was removed (new build goes to `client/dist/`)
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to API endpoints
- Development workflow remains similar
- Tests and linting not yet implemented (future phases)

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
**Next Phase**: Consider implementing Phase 1 (Foundation) or Phase 2 (Developer Experience) from the roadmap
